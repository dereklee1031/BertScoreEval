9b658e90-8bcd-489b-8cad-d16bfcfc908d,"It also supports multilingual translation. So Yeah. Yeah, there we go. So yeah, I mean, that's it. So we're actually set up for the call. There's a couple of things I wanted to show you. Cool, And that's yeah, other than that, I've personally been quite busy with the fundraising and the marketing side of things. So that's sort of what's on my plate, but I've been doing it all. It's a startup, so your job is not very linearly defined. And that's probably both a, yeah, it's picking up things that are tweaking the AI in the background. So that's Definitely gives me a much better idea of what the product actually is. I can start with a little bit of background about myself because I don't think we've had much of an introduction. I did talk to Roshna, but just do. Let's use this time. I want to understand what you're doing and what your motivations are. What are you looking for in an engagement? What would make it a cool engagement for you? Sounds good? Okay. Perfect. about my so I LSE won't go coursework into much detail has been over going that. to shit because of all of the things that I'm I doing. am from India so I am right now in Hyderabad but I was in Delhi before this and before that I was in Punjab so my parents are in Hyderabad and I will be I do commute back. What I'm looking for to be honest nothing too specific I would be I'm gonna be very truthful in saying that I have realized in the past two weeks that I very much enjoy I would be over the design and I would side be like of things over promising and this is something you if already mentioned as well. I say that yeah, I In can the spend sense like that a lot I of time again on this do not and have I would too not many be doing technical justice skills to this, because of the fact that I never the went team into or it. myself if I take on too many things and not do it properly. But as I said, my parents do have an AI background and something that I've always wanted to explore. And but yeah, all like of I it would be so time I'd constraints say two and it things really that hurts me. I could benefit from from this first is being involved in a bit of the finance side of things because um a you're already onboarding a new member. So I think it would be easy for you to just have this as a slight like team of like two people that you're onboarding so that would make your training aspect and all of that much easier. And second of all, I learned from it massively. Other than that, you know, happy to be of any other help. It makes a lot of sense and I see I think it's coming back to this bot. It's It did capture everything, right? Yeah, yeah. I think it's all there. Cool. Sorry, I'm also like, why hasn't it shows the two different boxes rather than one, right? Oh, that's not What happens is that when people talk, they're usually like five minute monologues. And that's not a criticism. I do that a lot. I have like 10, 15 minute monologues. And so you just have like a blue wall that you had five apps. Yeah, so I mean, it's one line of code that can be changed. But there, that it picked that up. Cool. So it picked up the reminder that I set for a UI glitch review, whatever. a first year student from the And rest actually of records your these things not on Asana or Jira right now, but on an internal database. So, you know, we can review it. But anyway, coming back. So you mentioned quite a lot of things. Firstly, let me say congrats, like on just sort of being so proactive in your career. Some of the stuff that you're involved, like if you didn't tell me that you were resume doesn't come across as if you would be. Thank you. Yeah. So that's Pretty impressive People take different and I paths think in their I career. think I see a bit of sort of my own experience in that as well because I did like I think eight or nine internships by the time I finished my four-year program and So and progressively they got better Whereas a lot of my friends they were too burnt out of right from their boards and so they just took the first two years a bit easy and so it was a bit of a catch-up thing in like the third and fourth year, I mean, you know The other thing you mentioned At least at around a personal level for being me, careful it's about not so your much time. about So that's like a good realization to have when you're young. And making sure that you're using it well, it's not a bad thing. So I won't ever hold that against someone. I think it's a pretty smart thing to do. And actually, the decision to quit Big Tech and start up is also pretty much informed by the same rationale. letting a boss or a paycheck decide what my time is worth. And so there's only so many years you've got to live. And so it's important to try to lift your fullest potential. So I think I'm aligned there. And you don't need to apologize for it. Now, did you mention you were in Hyderabad? Oh, yeah. Right I see, I see. But you spend most of the year and you will be spending most of the year. your time in London, we have work across the board so you mentioned a few right? Yeah, I only go back for like vacation. So one month in like the winter, one month in the summer and hopefully not in the summer because hopefully I will have an internship here and I won't have to go back but maximum like two months. frankly like Got it. Okay. And awesome. Okay. So now in terms of some of the stuff that you are interested in, right? And so something around like design, right? And I think... And then how do we move licenses So finance from a... is very broad, right? There is accounting, there is accounting and cost management, right? There is also corporate structuring. So like a question of like, where should we incorporate? Should we incorporate in Dubai? Should we incorporate in Delaware, Estonia, the UK, gift city in Gujarat, India, and then there are different laws and different costs, right? And then there is an intellectual property side of things. to like child goals, right? And so there's corporate structuring as a part of it. of a package, that's also, technically And that defines sort of a, that creates sort of a blueprint with how we engage. coming back to the thing And then And so it's great that you have like a broad interest in it. But I would also invite and ask you like, OK, are there specific areas? Because what I wouldn't want is to share some work with you that is somewhat related to finance, but not your idea of what it would be. Finance would be or could be. essentially deliverables that you feel comfortable with. And that will also add a bit of structure. I think that would be quite helpful for you in terms of what you take away from the experience. So let's say you close a deal or are instrumental in closing a deal for us. That is phenomenal experience across the on the design side of things that is design work to be done. board, from sales, marketing, business development to finance. But I've also worked as a designer. Oh nice! Where was that? That was at Google. So I designed a lot of projects in the various roles that I held there. And so while I was not designing like the Google Maps client, I designed a lot of internal products as well. of iteration around what it can look like and what it cannot look like and so on. So anyway, it's not about me, it's about you. for me because I was like, I can't keep doing this over and over again for like a two, 3% raise. Like, yeah, I don't know how much you know about the British economy, but it's just, it's just, right. Yeah, it's something we don't talk about. Still optimistic that So now there are a few ways that I'm helping my co-founder also. move from tier two, which is an employment based visa to a talent based visa, which you can if you are deemed as a person of like exceptional ability and potential to add to the UK economy and so on. And so there are ways of ways of staying. Yeah, ways of staying. Yeah, you can also marry a British person, right? You can also like there are you can open your own business. I would consider You can also kill it in the stock that. market or you can and then reinvest a certain amount of money back into the UK economy and come on an investor visa I think it'll be like 600k I don't know memory so you can also get a Portuguese visa or Portuguese anyway immigration is this own we can have a separate call so immigration discussion okay Yeah, it's my machine. So when I minimize it, it's basically not giving any browser, any process. Yeah, I stopped loading. I was going to say, but I didn't want to interrupt you. No, never mind. Yeah, I think it's back. Basically, it doesn't run in the background. It needs to be in the foreground. When I minimize it, it stops. OK. Interestingly time enough, gap. the loop is probably the shortest in a startup. But I don't know how much you know about the software development life cycle. Yeah, but the process of going from design to a product that an end user is using and it's in their hand, that takes, it takes time. Right. Yeah. And so, yeah. Like, so typically there is anywhere between like a six month to a one year I say light of day. Sorry? That's also like Well, yeah, yeah. So I mean, like I personally used to find that very frustrating and design work like, you know, I created a design and then it's out of my hands and then the product team and the engine team will prioritize it whenever they prioritize it right. And it's not their fault. It's just, you know. like they have like a million priorities. I showed you the feature list. Yeah. And so actually there is one feature in there that sat down and thought about it enough. So. Yeah, I like there is design work as well. But yeah, no promises. Not like we'll start working on it right away. Like you can you can create a design, we can all get some feedback on it. We can even get customer feedback on it. But yeah, it'll take a long time before it, you know, quote unquote comes to life. Right. So Yeah, I think I think my I'm basically throwing the question back at you, right? I can give you Like which jurisdiction does the IP fall under, for example. That's something that we need a bit more clarity on in the next two, three weeks. And I can actually partner you with my CFO who's essentially a chartered accountant turned VC. And he's quite a successful VC based out of Gurgaon. So that's another, but his clients are all around the world. That's the solution, yeah. Right. current It's called design engagements partner, but it's not UI and design the fact in the that traditional you're in university sense. right It now is. positions us well for is If you're in touch with a lot of other startups, we are looking for our first clients and our first design partners, right? So that is something that and so I sorry I say design partners, but that's not user Well, it is and it isn't it is So purely on there the finance is design side then work I can there, pull right? you So I think that's a very rounded thing. And actually that's something we really need. If you want to focus purely on design, then yeah, I can, there is one feature I had in mind, which is a complex feature and it integrates like a lot of other things from the app. So that's something that you can have a crack at designing, right? If it's just a pure design thing you're looking for. Then if you want to focus, Then the task can be more around PR, PR communications and representing us to essentially VC. So that's a completely different role. And it's very communication heavy. So it sounds like finance. Finance is just a small, like that 5% that You're kind of on your phone all the time and just like. and so on. So What's really interesting for you and by the way, just because you pick one doesn't mean you can't do another. So I want to be mindful of your of your time and the other cool thing is that it's early days, right? It's like first year for you for offer three year program. Yeah, so there's a bit of time before you graduate as well. 2 million in investment. So it's not it's not a I'm just saying, we'll figure out a way to do that. So yeah. Okay, great. So just based on that, first of all, I want to say that I wasn't even thinking about like the long like again, it is very much like, we'll see how it goes. So even if it's like, you know, we'll see if Again, and I'm that wondering definitely not as a much conflict as of all of, interest okay, since first you of know all, what seemed it most is interesting out of all of the things that you were saying was definitely the VC aspect of it only because I've just yesterday had a meeting with early born VC. We're talking to true VC to do like an office visit for the Kickstart program. So I'm heavily involved with VCs and it would be really cool to be a part of an actual startup where we will be pitching. And again, I will be doing that for uni. It's an entirely different startup, but I will be getting some kind of experience there. I However, would love to explore what I as think you said you know. that leads me to is that, as you said, that requires me to have a lot of engagement. So I'm not sure if I will be able to, especially since you're in the early stages and need to absolutely ensure that you're making the best impression. I'm not sure if I would be the most reliable person for that right now, given that I may have other things going on. At the same time, I do think that in the long run, the things about, you know, IP and like finance, you know, but how much are we costing things, sales and all of that. I think that that also sounds that was the second thing that seemed most interesting to me. However, I am not the most skilled. As I said, I've not done financing before I've organized events or managed like, you know, budget of let's say like, OK, there's a school prom and there's like, you know, four lakhs that we have to like use to get things done. But other than that, I do not have too much of financial experience, but I do think that In which the long run, again AI would when have a little I bit have more time some more to capacity, I learn would because. love, love to be involved with getting investors and even like first clients and all of that, unless you think there's any way of me being involved marginally with that as of now as well. But I think the second best option, which right now seems the most feasible to me, is being a little bit more involved in the finance side of like costs and accounting and all of that stuff. everything and also be able to see if what I was on boarded on for is the best thing or if there's something else I like to switch to. a little closer to product. sounds like we're parking the work on design, right? Just to make sure we're on the same page here, with design, did you mean actual UI UX design? This is going to be blue, or this is going to be gray, and x pixels off the right, x pixels off the left, that kind of stuff? Or feature prioritization, which is? you said that most of those things have a bit of a longer timeframe. So even if I'm not directly involved with it, let's say there is like, you know, some design, let's say a specific feature that you're designing. would be best if I am kind of like shadowing that for a bit, seeing what it's all about and then contributing to it. even in our sort of external pitch deck, we have... Yeah, essentially that a you pricing will get and access a cost section, to. right? And so like, you are pretty much contributing to the external pitch deck, even if you're sort of working on internal finance, especially at this stage, right? So one project that I can think of, which is interesting, and you can sort of kind of do in your time, and it takes a little bit of headache off. And you also mentioned you were interested in like learning a bit about the AI space. I think this is sort of really, really valuable information. So, like, yeah, let me just give you some background here, right? So currently this little box that you're seeing with our transcriptions, it's connected to, like, OpenAI backend, right? And OpenAI has a certain cost structure for how many, like, millions of tokens we throw at it in terms of, like, LLM transcriptions. And then similarly, you have Gemini from Google, you have Perplexity, then so we you have a few providers, right? You can use a proprietary software like any of these and they all have some pros and cons vis-a-vis Then others are saying no, it's your data. For some you can get into a custom contract with them, pay them like a million bucks a year. And let's say that you can use our infrastructure. And we will not train. our model on your or run board. And there's a few. We have a tracker. And so they all have a cost structure. And the cost structure typically ties into how much graphic processing power you're using, because that's the technology used for LLMs. And also how much and like training obviously effort having you're gonna our put own in. proprietary So there's inference, model makes which us is the much model more investable. working live, right? And just giving us like results on in like, just as charge GPT does. And then there's training, which is happening offline, right? Which is making the model smarter, right? Which is basically improving the model. It's not about like an instant response. It's just model training, right? And that's also very expensive. So you have this cost lever on the training side, you have this cost lever on the live inference side. As a company, we have our own IP. We get smarter on our clients'data. Our base model that we offer to everyone gets smarter. And so it's very critical to the... how the long-term does that cost strategy scale with of the y business. So at this point in time, we have this spreadsheet where we've done a review of a few servers and the tech team has done some investigations on, well, if I do X inferences on this model or this setup, so one particular model on one particular server and then we run the test and we get a certain cost for it. How does that cost scale? at the machine. and see like, okay, this is the dollar cost I'm incurring at the machine. This is what it costs to deliver this at scale, right? Then this is the pricing I offer to my clients. And this is how we compete with other competitors in the market. There aren't too many that are doing all this right now, but there are many utilities that are offering sub features, right? combination of so what is the true value of those sub features? And are we competitive as a company all those sort of utilities together. So that's one. And then bringing that into the pitch deck with the ultimate question of are we investable or not investable, one sheet. So you'll see like cost and prices are a lot of layers. So I'm already thinking, so there's a pitch deck I shared with you. I think I've updated that. So that old link will not work. I'll send the new one with you. So on the new pitch deck, you'll see some numbers, right? And maybe similar to the numbers you saw earlier, but there are some numbers. And then there is, Which costing is and accounting. underlying all of that which has the cost and the projections right so costs and then projections with X customers Y employees over the next five years, right and then underlying that is the technical infrastructure cost right? How much does the meeting boss cost? How much are we paying for network services? How much are we paying for the database? That's quite technical. Right? Yeah, but it is it is like It is technology finance in some sense, right? Like it is how And so there's a lot of outbound research. Bring some clarity to those numbers, right? Basically reduce your arrow bands on your estimates essentially. Yeah, so I mean, so that's what I'm thinking of that something we need, I think that touches. pretty much all aspects of finance and it goes from the The second And thing then, you mentioned, which is actually yeah, also the getting thing numbers you felt from them. It's like, might OK, be this server, how much does it more actually apt cost? Or how going much into the first, did this experiment right? cost? In order to be successful for this, you will need to effectively harass the tech team a little bit, asking them, firstly, A, learn about tech, right? So this is how this works, this is how this doesn't work. Some of it will be on their website, some of it is not on their website. You'll have to be on calls for like long hours and just... No, not long hours, but like... Get it out. There are like four of us, right? So it's not like you're lost in... organization time consuming of like 500,000 it would be. people like Amazon or Google, right? There's just four of us. So you can have a list of like 10 questions and then just bring it. And then just make sure that you record your own answer so you can build your own sort of framework and model. Right? Yeah. Okay. So I've been, I've been rambling for a bit. I think this is something that seems like it's at least most aligned with your expressed interest in terms of how I think that's a bit of, that's up to you, right? So I think you can do a job of it in a couple of weeks. You could also work on it for like a month or two because I think it is gonna take us about a couple of months before we're nearing something like an MVP, right? So it's. It's going to take us some time. And we're pretty flexible for our first few customers because we want to land the product more than like make a profit off the first few customers. Like any reasonable startup. So it's not super time critical in that sense. You can take your time with it. And in an ideal world, this is not something that you do once and then you're done and dusted. It's, I That's not the ask. It's a... for someone working in finance, they would be doing such an analysis on a certain cadence, like bi-annually or something like that. more of like but but actually is that something that sounds interesting is that something you want to get into Uh yeah, 100%. I think also that the fact that a lot of these things are also new to me is what I think good is that that's what I want to get out of it. I do think that a lot of like other startups that I mean, I'm kind of doing like, again, which is not bad at all. Of course, I'm getting better at them, but it's like things I've done. I'm just doing them again, which is definitely adds value, but I don't think adds that much value. But I think this would I would learn a lot. Of course, that would mean I would need a slightly more time to ensure that I'm getting everything right. Yeah. And with those three artifacts, the questions that I would have, and by the way, they're not gospel. Some of them are more or less right. Some of them are work in progress. So I think the cost structure that I will share with you, that is... mostly accurate. The projections in it are just projections. So they're as accurate or inaccurate as any other projections. Server cost document is work in progress. So it's basically like the ENJ team is testing these servers and identifying the dollar cost of them. And they've done some of these experiments. then on And some then multiple. over Whereas time, if you can own as it a and server that that like has concurrency you become the support, expert. we can have one server and then have it serve like 10, 15 customers based on an estimate of how frequently we will need to. There's a lot of product learning. So I think it's still not an easy project because you will need to drive that learning. put in it. It's like, this is what this cost I know. Then that makes it very, very invaluable. That makes your contribution very invaluable for us because anybody on the tech side is very focused on the engineering of any one or two of these verticals. Whereas we need a bit of a business overview of, I know what this means in a pure dollar sense. From a customer point of view, investor point of view, etc. That's where the business insight becomes. Yeah, meaty project, but not time critical. And I think lots of learning, like drinking from a fire hose kind of learning. Yeah, guys have done the what do you think? Fantastic. And I technical side but also the CFO has done more of the financial side. you think it's also really good that you have a CFO because it's not that again, I will be like, again, I do think that I'm competent in the sense that I will be able to learn whatever there is to and I don't think that I'm like the kind of person who would just leave it and being like, yeah, you know, like, half do something that I'm supposed to do properly. But yeah, it's also good that I will have like a little bit more guidance from someone who's done this before and like has a little bit more idea. So if I have questions, they wouldn't be entirely on me to figure working on 9 to 5, right? Caching a paycheck. So things have been moving. out. So heads up on the CFO. So the CFO knows very little about the documents I'm telling you about. He has very little context. Because I hired the CFO this week. It's a startup in the truest sense. August last year, there were zero employees, no product, no feedback. Moving fast, right? So actually, on the contrary, you might be onboarding the CFO once you learn all of this, right? And in exchange, I think the CFO can give you the right VC exposure. that you need. So once you are an expert, expert on the products, the domain, the cost, the market. then you can partner very effectively with the CFO who brings his connections in the VC world to actually make us investable. So the CFOs told me, okay, realistically, you can raise up to 2 million. I've seen companies at your level of rigor and what you've built to be able to raise that kind of money. But what the CFO lacks is the full context and background. So They are already running a company, started accountants and so on. So what the CFO told me is he has a like a 500 question questionnaire for me that filling which allows me allows him to represent us two investors. Sorry, I can't hear you. Bye for now. be like two word answer Perfect. So then I would have basically said, okay, go talk directly to the CFO. It would have been that simple. And then that would have carved the because they would have provided the questionnaire to you that would have become maybe part of the I know 500 questions sounds intimidating, but they're probably not. Right, yeah. is, let's say you were not coming on, right? I would have filled out that 500 question questionnaire. Well, so the way it's going to work I will have to do the, like the, he's not super into this industry, so I'll have to still figure that out. It's He a would very, have assigned very good a intermediate few experts step. from his team to basically, and then the experts would have been representing us to various VCs. And he would be signing off on the deals and representing us from like a legal and financial point of view, right? On the company documents. So that's how things would have flowed in that world. But I think for what you're trying to do, I think this could be a really good checkpoint. on Yeah, the a tech successful side engagement and the can answer a lot of questions for. I think the questions I'm going to ask, so I'm giving you three documents, and the two or three questions I have in mind are also the ones that are going to come from him. And then once he sends me his questionnaire, we can sync on it. And I think there might be some questions that you can essentially own in terms of getting some clarity around business. And yeah, like you will. But the some coaching product that side you can I think get you can from the CFO you have being my involved. time, right? Though that's So I not can something I've explicitly give you a lot of insights or whatever discussed. I know about AI and like product development My co-founder is a patent holder Rishit has applied for a patent. So we are also pretty technical folks Yeah, and then if you want more exposure to like the finance industry and how things work like I think that is also If I end up being of value then I'm sure I'd be more than like if I feel confident later of that I've provided value I can reach out to him myself about that like personally as well. So don't worry about that. Sounds great. Sounds great. So yeah, I mean, it's still a bit unstructured. I think it's an initial call. So figuring out what works for you, what works for us. But how do you feel about it? Like, do you want to dive into these two, three documents that I mentioned? And you can even take like the weekend to think about it and come back to me maybe next week. And if it seems right, then I'll give you based on those two three documents the maybe a few questions that are most pressing for me as a founder on the finance side. Which is, are we It evolves into a much more mature thing. Once the CFO sends me his 500 question questionnaire, at which point there is definitely an opportunity for you to just be outward facing in terms of like helping us land investment and actually, yeah, like. As a business intern and eventually a business employee, you will find yourself in these like interfacing with some of the investors. By the way, I don't think that your seniority precludes you from being able to speak with investors. You mentioned that, you know, firstly, it's nice that you had this thought that you want to make, it's, you know, early days for us and we must present ourselves very carefully to investors and so situations very, very often that you are the business representative of like an expert or a, you know, of a lot of investment, right. And you just feel like these are big shoes. So for example, when I was in the wearables team, there was a ex NASA scientist on a few million a year on our team, right. And I was his program manager in a sense, and I had not even of university And negotiating his timeline with other stakeholders at Google was just a weird experience for me. 20 years of experience. But I realized that that is what it means to be in this role. So I want to think about code at night and product development. And I have a million insecurities as a founder. And there are some that you can take away for us, which is just making sure that the slide deck or everything we're presenting outwards is just picture perfect. And that is something that you don't need to be like, in the industry for it. It's just a question of like rigor from the lens of an investor or a customer. Like does this look right? And then it's It's a lot of chasing people in the company to bring the product or the offering to that level. Sometimes it's not. It's sellotape and bubblegum. But that's the gap that a strong business employee or like a yeah essentially or a non-technical employee that's the gap they sort of fill in. Yeah. Which is covering over those gaps. I don't have a bias here. I think I'm perfectly fine with you representing us to VCs and investors, Right. It's like my second week at Amazon. I was told like go present this like 200 million dollar roadmap to the vice president. I was like, OK, like, right. But then you do it and then you learn. So there's no other way to. So don't worry too much about that. Like, I think that's that's fine. If you think for you, if you are aligned and sure, why not? Is the thing that I found most interesting, so definitely through the second, but it's good to know that the second option. The first option is still up for grabs. If not. hope you could do is do lean generation for us. like if not soon, at least sometime in the near future. It is. See, if we are just doing, if we just do the first one, right, like let's say just the first one, then I have to fill in for the second, right? Yeah. In terms of what the startup needs. And so your role will become a bit less finance and a bit more business development and outreach and communication. So you'll have maybe less context, but then what I might... bring get me on a table or like a meeting with like maybe 20 VCs in the next month. Right. And you can also be in the room because you made the introduction and so on. You might have low context on the business, lower context on the so that's a different kind of job. Yeah. Well, if you want to do that, It's not, it's not meeting with 20 VCs. And so I wouldn't share two of the decks with you. I won't share maybe a technical spreadsheet with you. Maybe even the first spreadsheet we can skip. Maybe you can just do the projections in the pitch deck. But then it's back to you, right? Do a blast, reach out to a lot of people and so on. I do think the established CFO has a bit more of a background here. So yeah, and like just comparative advantage in terms of how many replies you get. 500 question questionnaire. Yeah, that sounds great. So I will be going to New York tomorrow. It's my flight. but let's add a placeholder. do this so that's that's perfectly fine. Take your time. Yeah, that sounds good. Can you suggest something first before that? um the 23rd and 24th Yeah, let's have a look. So it seems like you're busy early next week. I see I see okay. Um Both of those work. 20th is actually, oh, you're in New York time zone. Yeah. And also like just when I reach my mom's going to be there only for the first two days. And I'm kind of like, you know, again, meeting up in like once in six months. So again, I think 22nd or 23rd would be ideal. We can even 27th. Okay. Yeah. Okay. British time? Yes. How is this time for you by the way? On 8 o'clock? Yeah, 8 o'clock sounds good. Wait, can we do 8.30? I'll just have a meeting ending just at 8. So in case it runs over, 8.30 would be good. So that'll be okay. Okay, yeah. So 8.30 on we need to build, we need to improve. Great. And will I be getting the list of tasks as well from such as is it such as how do you pronounce it? It's such a it's such a it means it means assistant or secretary and Sanskrit. Amazing. Interestingly. No. So not as yet simply because we we have the we have it in a database. We haven't pushed the send button simply because it's not a perfected feature yet. If there's a lot of garbage in it. So we need to build like deduplication. We're still very prototype stage and not MVP stage, but we'll get there. Yeah, course. We'll get there. Well, this sounds amazing. I'll talk to you on the 27th then. And till then, please do send me the documents. And if there's anything else that, like any other questions that pop up in the meanwhile, I'll send them over to you and you know where to find me as well. Sounds"
febc3387-bb94-41d1-bed0-0abd1403da0e,"zero management experience, which was my mistake. So we lost the third tech intern, sadly. like just disengaged. But yeah, this is. It has a slight cold start where it will start picking up transcripts. Cool. And we've got a call back to GPT-4 every 15 to 30 seconds. There's a bit of a trigger logic. like it works when there is a healthy sort of back and forth. Yeah, and then basically what will happen is like we'll have some suggestions and action items that will keep. popping up here. So if I say, I usually let's connect on Thursday. So that's basically a very right prompt for the model to. Yeah. We'll let it run on the site. So I shared a bunch of material. Okay, we can also catch up in general. Are you in Gurgaon by the way? How are you managing? No, in 2019. So it's been five years since I've been working. out of the Bangalore office. But my team and everyone is based out of Bangalore. Makes sense. okay, that's cool. Yeah, I thought you were... can you can see it's like it picked up some there was some loading. I need to increase the timer on that, but you know that's fine. So there is not much else to the demo. So in the backend, I'm collecting all these prompted actions. Right. Oh, actually, there is a feature I added last week, which is the post-meeting email. So actually, I've got like 10 or 11 teams and and learn itself on board it to use the product for customer discovery calls. So there are certain I mean, so you obviously get a recording and you get the full transcript. of the meeting, right? And in a nice email. Let me see if I can pick. an example and show you. But I added sort of one. nice feature as well, which is the bomb test. We had this session with Antler. They said if you're doing customer calls, try not to pass the... like try not to pass the mom desk, which is basically failing. a customer discovery call, which is asking any questions that you're. Mom might say yes too, right? Like it's like, Oh, would you do anything? Anything that's forward looking? Would you pay this much for it? and try to make reasonable inferences from that. So anyway, so it adds a little bit of value over like otter and fireflies and those kinds of things for the users on ground today in a specialized customer discovery. use case, right? But I think the long-term goal is very clear. We just want to update. We want to focus very much on project management. So go from meeting transcription, which is already solved to Scrum meetings to more generic project management to program. And maybe three to four years down the line, I also want to, or at least once I land a considerable chunk of this roadmap, I want to start to teeter into product management. First, because I think the... really help us go down the sort of like product management track. as well and start to explore that space then trying to. kind of do that upfront. And then second, like program management is very structured, deterministic output, right? like the focus is on killing business admin. Product can be a little more risky in that you're taking like bets on behalf of the company and like. trying to get there. Anyway, so I wanted to show you one more. a thing really quick which might give you a sense of like this, like auto. She said, I got to go. Yeah, this is a good one. Yeah, so let me change the presentation. Do Yeah. So this button I want to like. basically lead into a calendar. There's a calendar also in development. Let me see if I can pick that out. But here you can see sort of a, let me see if I can make this a bit nicer. Yeah. So some key insights and then, you know, a leading question was passed the bomb test, but this is sort of working in a like post meeting kind of summary format and then. Okay, this was, I was testing this email feature. So this got like folded. But obviously you just get one complete transcript. I'll show you this one as well. Yeah, don't do the panels of a small laptop screen. Okay, so yeah, these are just some like calendar entries and then the idea would be like Right now, I still have to click a button to get the bot in, but you'll be able to kind of manage. which ones is it coming to on its own from this UI. So I'll check this in but. the idea is this link would sort of. open to this. And then obviously this is also not on brand but That's the state of the product. In terms of state of investment, so there is a Right. But like tonight I have a call with a guy and. How would I be? We've been talking for about two and a half, three months now. So it's my Like third or fourth call with him. So he's more agreeable at that like 2 million and 10 percent kind of terms. like I don't know if it's going to materialize or not. I have a list of like 400 vcs I want to do an email blast to. I haven't done it because And so having the founding team nailed up, even if you notice, right, like. The pitch that I shared with you there is like candidates. I've been talking to Right. So all of them have their different asks and then a lot of them are in like existing sort of full time jobs and those kinds of things. But like It's a decision I have not landed yet. Last week I was going to make an offer. to a guy who is also a pretty strong candidate. He's been a director of engineering. at Fidelity Investments, you know, visiting CS faculty. The issue For me became like I realized that like this guy is not really in for founding. He's kind of more of looking for a job, right? So the good thing was that he tied his comp to company milestones. like I want this much at 250 million, 250k raise, this much at half a million. And then didn't have a very big equity ask but then I realized that he's looking for like a per hour Very fishy. This is going down the fractional CTO directory. which is a mistake I'm not going to make again. So the cap table is clean. like any contractual agreement set. May, if everything goes well, and I hope is YC comes through before it. Yeah, anyway, so he told me like, oh, can you ask the VC to like. seven days and I was like dude this is you might be like a tech lead I might still hire you but you're not a co-founder. You're not my co-founder anyway. So that kind of sent me, yeah, that's why I was back on like YC Founder matching. and I spent two months nicely onwarding him. He didn't write any of the code by the way, but he was like starting to kind of sink his teeth into it. Pretty smart guy, right? like patent holder and like a vision space. But he told me April he'll join full time. And then finally he got that call scheduled like three weeks ago and his lawyers told him doing like 13 hour days, right? So it's like not really. He couldn't really do much through the week. on board the digital aligned client. So it had like four calls with him. and you've got a shared of 15 page contract with him. So he wants the product ASAP. He's like Abhi Dev Meco. I was like, no, no, give me two, three months. And then now I'm like also, um... But the thing is, it's not so much the contact with him. or his team alone that is interesting but his company is working with the financial sector so he has downstream clients for whom he's providing basically technology services to finance companies. He wants to actually sell our AI program manager as a service. to the tech teams in these finance companies. So I already agreed on a rate with him. which is my breakeven rate on the bot calls. For now, it's about $1.30 per hour of the bot being in the call. So you would think that it's. There is no training going on as such tokens are marginal cost okay like it's hardly anything an entire meeting our long meeting is only like You can actually 10x that if we make some modification. For example, Every subsequent call is taking the entire context of the meeting, leading up to the into it, right? But if you're just working with the deltas, it's different. And then we don't have our own lag. as the actually want to build one. So experimented with Milbers and a few other. pieces of tech, but we've not hooked it up together. So the predominately the cost actually comes from having a... We're not building and managing this tech. We're using a provider. spun up like a Docker instance VM and then have like an agent. signing in, right, and attending the meeting. So you've got real-time audio streams coming in and it's a lot of like architecture to maintain. Eventually, I think we might want to go down that route because Having said that, the provider is pretty great. So they're like an XYC company. And when I was trying to figure out a solution for Zoom. month and a half. You don't even reply to me. So he got so much public defamation on the forum. In two hours they were like, no no boss what do you want? I got like two emails from their team. just to even talk to them for like an enterprise contract. So that rate. for now boils down to like 500 per month that I pay them and then it's like a dollar. $20 for the meeting bots in any platform. So you've got Zoom, Meet, MS Teams, and Slack covered. I think they also did Cisco WebEx. They don't have a Discord yet. And WhatsApp and Telegram are in the long-term roadmap. and with an API call you can change the transcription provider as well. So we don't have to build that infrastructure as a P0 P1. and like that's kind of it can we can handle it in year two or three. But that's the stack. So a lot of the work right now is actually just refining the intelligence from the meetings. Right. Dude, I posted a founding CTO job. So if you notice on the deck. it finished the free quota of job applicants you can get. Right. So I think anyone who's faced this issue of like having worked with managed or needed program managers like the product Right? And okay, I am an engineer. I'm a good engineer. But there are a few engineers that are better than me. Yeah, like, tech ownership long term is not my happy space, right? 6 to 10 months in a tech lead role, I'll get unhappy. I learned that at LinkedIn itself. like before I came to Google. I wouldn't be looking for like a more business oriented role outside, otherwise. Anyway. these really senior candidates applied and then I realized they're just taking me for a ride. They like wasting my time. And the other thing I wanted to filter out for was I didn't after two months of working with this guy and then another like Teco found a guy earlier there was another guy actually so first from who is like X meta and then was a n-inch guy at reddit And yeah, it was all talk, no action, right? I wrote our entire YC application and then he didn't. We didn't manage to put in a line of code after even 6 weeks. I was like, yeh bhi dead hai. I can't be writing the code and selling and doing everything. like and then So I had enough negative experiences from that to... Otherwise, I have no particular interest in having like 40. the 41 hour calls with people. I also don't have the time. I should be pitching. because we are in a competitive space, as you can tell. bought into a meeting and then the tools that actually become. predominant there will then become the providers of APIs to other. other tools in the industry. So the user will win one bot that does everything. and then other people become consumers of that bot and that intelligence. that CTO assignment if you click through. Let me see if I can pick that up. C P O S I M E R K The interesting thing here is actually this one. Yeah, so on the right hand side, at the moment we're talking to APIs. Eventually it would be like agent to agent communication, right? But the thing that is going to be our secret sauce is like. this intelligence layer and how we manage the context. essentially trigger actions, right? So this is a stuff that we want to get really, really. good act like this is what is our right to say we'll be the best AI program manager. brain in the business. And then all this stuff will keep changing. I don't look at them as competitors. I look at them as surfaces. And yeah. for the most part, solved. And then in the future, we can do some pretty cool stuff like. We can do emotion detection, we can do tone detection. Right, because we have the audio video feeds, which is a huge advantage. So we're not just a a thin solution on a... transcript, which I don't think is a very competitive position to be in in the market. Yeah, OK. That's a very quick high level. walk through and yeah, very happy to do it. happy to catch up in an hour. I'll basically be hearing that same yarn too. Another would actually one person who did the assignment. with someone I have chemistry with, right? So. It's been a very long monologue, so I just want to get to your thoughts. And actually, if you have specific questions. No, I think this was useful. So thanks for explaining. like giving me the lay of the land, a very helpful context. I do have a bunch of questions, obviously. Of course. Right. I think you talked about competitive space. So I'm just getting the fact that we have four minutes left, so you don't have to answer all of them right now, but like you know. I think that is definitely. the potential competitors. I mean, you say there's surfaces and so on, but Let's hope that's true, but let's be real, too. They just need to like. Any of them have to do one small... Product strategy and all this is unclear. But that was obviously one question, especially like, you know, the I think more than meet and zoom or workspace. I was actually concerned about the... the project management. wave. Yeah, Jira and the likes. Yeah, so great question. And actually, there's one guy who's like, In meeting, intelligences are distant afterthought. Like they're not running after that, right? They're trying to... do this like they're trying to stay within like they have this unfortunate position of like having so much legacy that they're doing incremental building around it, right? So what their approach or their strategy is like, oh, you come to a class inside. And then you have a chat box, right? And then you say like, this is what I want to do or organize my projects this way, something like that. And that's the path they're going up. Where we can add a tremendous amount of value is you plug into Meetings and plug into Meetings across multiple platforms. integrations we hook up with Slack. We are going to absorb your company database of all your docs and your notion docs, right? And create a rag intelligence. on top of it. Jira's a law. I'm not saying they wouldn't do it. I'm just saying for them to catch up to this and build around this. Thing is they don't care about zoom. account for more than 40% of their revenue. I think it's just actually a handful of lives. 40 or so companies that actually make like 80-90% of their earnings. So for us, B2C play is interesting. These users from Antler are interesting right but actually I just want like two or three Fortune 500 companies. And so we don't need to be a billion dollar unicorn. What we need is we need to land like. Right. If not a hundred million, two hundred million dollar company, which is a And then for a lot of investors and potential co-founders that have shown this app and offering too. They say that your chances of getting acquired in like two to three years are extremely high. or in a sauna that ends up buying us. And let me paint a fourth scenario. Worst case, we don't get acquired. Actually, we decide if we want to get acquired or not depending on our trajectory. near majority market share. Having said that, it's still a unicorn company. So the pie is so big in terms of sheer number of meetings that are happening around the world. Awesome. Just give me one second. Let me just sort. Sort that out really quick. Let me just see what's going on here. Emergency point. OK, that's fine. So this person I had a call with is like. Someone senior at Amazon, I'm not surprised they have to do it. last minute reschedule. Dude, those years, that was also a great experience. A year and a half at Amazon. Anyway, Yeah, so it's, the market is huge. There are a lot of meetings happening. And also, one advantage we're going to have is our users are going to be very sticky. Once we have adjusted all the data. It's a Google Workspace kind of product. You're not going to use Google Workspace for three years and then... shifting to Microsoft Office is going to be brutal. There is a lot of market player as well. Right? Like, let's say we become the dominant solution in Indonesia, Egypt. Right. And Japan. Right. Firstly, the one one cool thing. Hindi ...and he will translate it into English. translate and we can switch seamlessly between Hindi and English and it's not going to have a problem. So the marketplace play here is also interesting. if we just become a good solution into our three market cases. We still are interesting as an acquisition target to enter into those market spaces for a company that might be lenses with which I, it's a valid question by the way. I had it, but that's kind of how I see it. I'm calling bullshit on that. It's totally good. I actually value. value any input like that. If you're not convinced, I'm not being defensive, right? Like, tell me you're not convinced, tell me why. And yeah, we can talk about it. No, I think I understand your point. Well, you're right that the pie is big. I agree with that. You also write that. because this is a B2B play, unlike B2C companies where you need to have like some sort of a... the majority or something here if you have 1% of the pie you're probably still making or raking in like tens of millions of dollars and and that's probably a good place to be Maybe. So I understand that. And of course, I think it's a play of who got there first. because once you... do manage to sign up a customer, their cost of switching is But I agree with the other two. I say TBT because I think you're right with it. It's somewhere in the middle of my head because Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean all good points There is one more thing that I'm not talking about here. We obviously, my background gives us. So that space is crowded as fuck. That space is really hot. companies have raised 25, 50 million. So there's a, I'll tell you a couple. I actually have consulted a company that is trying to do that and they're not even They haven't even reached meeting intelligence. So if you look at. You slice an organization vertically, against like... What are the rules reporting to? So let me backtrack for a second. I am. trying to steer away a bit from the $20 per user. kind of market, right? And I really want to focus very much on enterprise sales and deliver value there, right? So in the enterprise sales side, you're selling to the C-suite. that everyone can use. No, it's more like, I will, what's the PNL. What's the salary cost of this entire department? And if I can streamline like 20-30% of their effort. then what is the budget available for that? I have 50 sales agents. These are the people they're talking to. They're a whole lead gen cycle, customer life cycle. That's a crowded space, right? And so I'm consulting with one team. It's called MakerOps, right? They're going after this. But there is a good reason to kind of go after what I am choosing to go after against these folks. of projects, right? That suddenly becomes a huge asset, right? You can lean on that, build on that, whereas... in that sales revenue off space, like you're dealing with your. Every second call is a new person, right? And so you don't really have any historical context on them. It's much more competitive. Then there is the AI product manager, there's the AI designer. that is the AI software engineer. And I think for those kind of... Program management, project management is a lot more structured graph. or that the company has a lot riding on it in terms of a risk. a pretty compelling ones from that lens. So there was a lot more thought here. Obviously, there's a bias with program, but then I've also been an engineer. I've also been a PM. So I could have gone after something else. This is the one that I think lends itself well to being solved. And then now from a product perspective. So I'm going to, you probably know better because you've been a program manager at Google as well, TPM if I remember correctly. I think I've sometimes wondered what they do, just program managers in general at Google. They're obviously like. respected in the organization to be honest, right? So I think like I mean, sorry, not to break your stream of thought, but that's definitely not what I felt at Google. But anyway. And I'm playing the devil's advocate here, right? It's more favorable for me to say like... Yes, I think it's a job role that's on its way out. thanks to products and solutions like this, but anyway. Yeah, but like I don't Sorry, Yeah, so the reason I was at a loss of words is because, of course, I myself... I'm sometimes confused how they spend 40 hours a week or what they do for during 40 hours a week. Reasonably heavily on their pgm director counterpart and I see that at the VP levels in our org I'm sure, by the way, every org is different. The dynamics are different. Like, as you said, you have... have all four of them. So maybe in some orgs, the PGM is the number four. on that list in the car. a director or the NGVP that takes that lead, right? So you see that variation, but like, yeah, I see some of the PGMs are on the... And maybe in your one you're saying that, okay, you know, 30% of what a PGM does will do for them. And hence, you need 30% less PGMs in your org. I'm actually going more aggressive Yeah. Is that actually? So there are two questions on the product side, right? One is that... We've all used software like JIRA and. Yeah, what's the other one Asana and so on? If there's a system generated email asking you to fill in a... text box with your The tendency to ignore it is maybe less. I'm not saying people don't ignore it. So there's that one challenge, right? This is human behavior and psychological behavior, right? What I've heard from a lot of people I've spoken to at Google in general is that PGMs are what are responsible in making sure that shit happens on time and all the executions happen and so on. on your basic premise of like, what does a pgm do? And actually let me. And you, I don't know if you worked as an EM, are you in an IC position right now or are you taking reports? on the IC transport with reports. Yeah. Wow. Okay. That's interesting. I think like the LM is a good place to be because you have like architecture responsibilities, you have a very broad view. Right now there's solid line reports, so I'm directly responsible for that. Okay, but you are also in part responsible for making short stuff ships. And you do, so who leads your scrum meetings? I do, we don't really have PGMs attend those. right? That could be something, well, a junior level PM could be in charge of them. But they'll have to be a strong team, you know, in a technical team, right, to be able to do it, right. And then I'm sure you have like, you know, your trackers or like, you know, like. 30 Baganizer tickets that are just very top of mind for the team. And then just updating it, like tracking it, you have a roll up. And if you're shipping a feature, then you might have some kind of like waterfall. or some timeline or a structure as to this needs to land in Q1. These are downstream dependencies, right? Like if we don't do this, then the other team gets screwed over. and we need the other team to ship this. And then there's a lot of like... coordination and a lot of meetings that need to be created, lots of emails that need to be sent out just to kind of What percentage of your work seems to be that as opposed to actually managing? actual coding and decision making on the technical direction for your team. a huge overlap within EM's work and a huge overlap with the PM's work. And it's a bit hard to respect the role of a PGM because The stuff that you don't want to waste your time doing, aligning calendars. looking up what's going on in that bug in either ticket. like excavation, finding out information or checking in with another team. Right. Or figuring out like. What is the status across your 15 bugs and what is the risk? quotient of a particular like project or program. and actual coding, building some of the most critical components off your application. And for a PM, the execution of it requires them to then chase meetings with if there's a pgm in the loop Obviously through the PGM, like various organizations, I need to... work in synchrony to land. And so the execution piece of it is a lot of graph for them that is. taking away from the core value of their job. And so a lot of the mechanics of the role of a TGM is actually making PMs and engineers more successful. those kind of things, right? But 85% of it is just like making sense of the noise, this coordination overheads. From my experience at Google, it's very common. It happens. And engineers and EMs can get away with that. a lot, right? It's like, didn't happen. What can you do, right? Maybe I'll ship next week. But a PGM will get killed. for that, right? Like they will get like they will and so they get That's why often they absorb a lot of compliance kind of shit. accessibility, compliance, release bits, those kind of stuff. push PMs and engineers around, right? And then. So any process-oriented kind of areas of technology. The governments will not survive without project managers and program and construction projects will never happen. And if you have something that talks like is if it's a feature that. works across like four organizations at Google than your pgms like a really important person. So that's just talking about a bit of what like the pgm is doing but I think a few of the interesting takeaways are like even in an org without pgms right Right? No notes. I'm just talking, right? And all the AIs are taken care of. it's supposed to reduce like 20 to 30 percent of an overhead of a non-PGM. And that's the major value addition. That's why teams. So that is a guaranteed execution. And then there is obviously the graph. of actually making show stuff land. Now you're right that one more thing you mentioned was that People ignore automated messages. But that's why we're doing things differently, right? So it's not just about like. pinging or poking a thread or a ticket. Also like by the way when they call a meeting There's an agenda for the meeting, right? So they're responsible for making sure meetings are run. explicitly dismissed by someone who has the right authority to be able to do it. And if it didn't get to that discussion, then the... PGM has to bend over backwards to make sure that that does get tabled again. that does come up in the discussion and the decision has a resolution. the actual output of a decision. That's much more PM design engineer territory. the content of what feeds the decision but they are even a suboptimal and everyone gets a voice in it, right? So they're not assessed by the quality of the decision as much as, I mean, to an extent they are. but only to the extent that all the stakeholders were able to participate in it properly. and nobody felt left out, right? And so the process around it was reasonable. and that the decision actually lands if something doesn't get discussed at all, if it was missing from the agenda. The PGM is responsible for that. If it didn't happen. So actually I have APIs for it to not only send chat messages into Google made so if you If you open the chat section here of this call. You'll see that when it joined, it sent a small message just letting you know that this is on the record. So I have three, video, audio, and transcripts. You could just say, hey, what's the status of that bug? And Sacha will just go and, you know. look it up and be able to give us an update here. So right now you're just seeing this like S, right? but I can display any content I want in real time in the meeting. That's something that Otter and Fireflies are not doing. they do not extend APIs for that. And even if they do, even if they are able to have some kind of a meeting. So it's a person in the room that's doing things for you. Even as a PJ, I... I often leaned on the authority of my director. So I think those are a few things, right? I mean, it's things. Yes, they get ignored. But one cool thing that is changing now is this is not a dumb script of like. It's much more contextual. It is aware of the... like the various opinions that go into make very contextually aware. interjections. So the step up in terms of oh here's a system to what this is supposed to be is going to be a significant lead. on two accounts. One is it's tapping into meetings. No product has done that before. And second, it's LLM driven, right? So it can understand. And so the intervention is going to make whether in meeting or offline or on your various tools. So, I will kind of leave it at that. You're quite right in identifying that we're not necessarily removing all PGMs in year one. And so the way I see it is a PGM using this is as good as like five PGMs. And that's sort of really the... This is just there in your meetings, right? Every morning you can say, okay. it can tell you, here's three things you absolutely should look at today. because I know your deadlines, I know your calendars, right? If it was in all your meetings through the day. Here's the major things that happened today and like, and you know. Here's just a quick recap if you want it. So those two emails at an individual level alone, right? and then the org roll up of like, here's a pulse of all the projects in your company. of what's risky, what's not risky, which we can update in a very real time manner. That's value that does not exist, and that is massive. But pgm can only do it for one project or whatever is within their very human limitations in terms of context absorption. or like contributing to a market roadmap, right? But they absorb a lot of context and a machine can do that way better than a human. So a single PGM can. Firstly, onboarding is easy. It takes PGMs three to six months to onboard onto a team. You're training a rag, you're immediately there. but also you have a single point to be able to consolidate. Hopefully, a good idea. So tell me what are the. When you started this call, you were talking about some numbers that you were discussing with. roughly speaking. So I'll... So in October when I applied I mentioned that Reddit X Reddit X Meta. Oh, are you talking about numbers in terms of like equity split or numbers in terms of like what? I was also curious to know. where you are at right now as well in terms of like. like you mentioned, I mean, you already have a working prototype. It's more than a product to be honest. It's almost like a working product, which is pretty cool to be honest So you obviously had some people build it. No, it's all me. So what about the interns then? If I check that in, that is the first working output. like hey, like check out that bag. But the thing is they're in college. They're not. I'm not paying them, they're working for experience. So I give them an experiment to run on like, OK, try this on three clouds. Here's a virtual credit card. which has some budget on it and report on the costs. The reason I've not used them for production code is like. that code is not good like it I can't use it. Right. Having and it's not even like there are there's also a lot of testing, but it works. It's a right. Their code I can't use for the most part. I haven't been able to. I'm slowly getting them there, right? So that's why all the coding production is mine. But they do a bit of research for me. like the Milvus rag experiment. that's something that they ran and demoed to me. Right, but yeah, like the couple of times I tried to. give them access to the code, like they brought the site down. And there was some like extremely worrying. I was like, you know what, we'll get there. So they need a bit of like management as well. You're L3, L4, they're not at the end of it. One is doing a. I think biocomputational engineering at Imperial, but he wants, he's very much in on AI. So the last project he did was running vision models on mammograms to determine if like He's from Raffles in Singapore, which is an elite school. It's like quota, freaking IT Delhi quota grade kind of grant. So he's great. The other guy is Rishit. He's very smart, but like... At the same time, he has superpowers when it comes to building a team. He's got very high energy and drive. He recruited my other intern. So the ones who stayed on it. are good, like I'm happy to kind of keep working with them. And my goal is to be able to be their most competitive job offer. when they graduate. So that's the goal with that. So, we got these are the working prototype or the prototype or pre-product. Yes. I mean, I won't have users if there was no. product, but the product they're using today is still a percentage of what it needs to be. So the folks in Antler. But the digital line obviously needs much more. product on this more of an enterprise. I have a 15 page contract that I have with them. a SaaS checkout rate and how are we going to navigate that? So it's a much more robust kind of engagement. And we are pre-product for being able to fulfill something of that nature. But we're getting there. So in terms of users, I think that's a question I've already answered. like something like 10ish companies at Antler are using it now for customer discovery calls. but that's a good kind of thing to have. I went for an equal split with the guy applied to Yeah, it was an equal split going in. But I've been full time on this since October. So then I started talking to a guy in JAG. And then in basically March 15th, he tells me like. Yeah, it's going to take me another six months. So with him, I... I thought like, and also, I mean, like, it's something I really depending on the value I So with him, I went in with something like. 3565 was the thing, but he wanted a closer to an equal split. So I The agreement we had was 4060. But I would also want to know... like what someone's green zone is right and the guy now I'll just share his profile with you, this guy. This guy who's like chilling in Italy. Right, with him. Sorry, just a sec. So you can also have a look because I think I still not close the door on bringing him along. So his expectation is he wanted 12% and some cash. So it's like if you raise 250k then I want like 45k. a year, right? Or like something like 60, 70k. Actually it was 90k on 250k race. He's like $45 an hour and then some miles on the night I Once we are, once cache is not an issue for us, then we can converge at the same kind of target. 1% on delivering the MVP. That was with him. So in terms of just sharing information with you as to where we are. That's kind of those have been the discussions. I approach him for a co-founder position as well. I was trying to figure out if for a policy project if these coal plants that are claiming to have shut down have actually shut down or not, right? Which is fun. I can send you that thing. But so we had lots of fun chats. And so within the discussion was also something like 40, 60%. So it's not like, oh, I'm just like trending down. Obviously I value a lot. made my other 60% extremely valuable. He's quite an accomplished gentleman. So by the way, that thread is still alive. So I think you might. go in a different direction in terms of the startup he wants to work on, but he loves this. idea as well. So I brought him on as a, or actually just this morning I extended a tech advisor offered to him like a board board advisor offer to him for like 0.25%. So we have that resource as well in terms of AI LLM steer. We'll have to figure out what it's going to look like. But yeah, that's another thread. But at the moment, it's like 0.25% for this step. Yeah, that's the cap table as it starts, right? So the way I would normally approach it is like ask you like what's your What's your green zone? Right? What's your green zone in terms of like? it being exciting enough for you to come on. The only thing I would ask is like, these six months have probably been the hardest six months of my life. And so my only request would be to. I don't want to come in and say like this is like it's a conversation. So I really want to make sure that it's also interesting and exciting for you. Right? To like, like, like take it for the long haul, right? Take it on for the long haul. So yeah, that's some numbers on equity, that's some numbers on. There's also investment side numbers so Antler if that comes through will give us 250,000. I'll just forward the email that Sacha sends us after this and you'll get a recording of this entire conversation. So you can just download it. So I can see, I think you're taking notes, which is great. But that's a thing of the past, man. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Feel free to take the notes that I'm relevant to you. for 9%. So that's a 2.75 million valuation. But the truth is it's not half a million. I'm really excited about YC because they also give you 900,000 in... credit that you can use to train models. So the real valuation of IC is actually 1.4 million. or 7 plus x, x is depending on our subsequent. And yeah, Investor Blast is spending but That's something that I would want to chase with my tech team. sort of in. You only get like so many chances at a first impression. And so I don't want to exercise that option quite as yet. There are two elements of the deck that are really weak for me. One is the go to market. and the other tech co-founder being a solo founder. Like those are two things that. are both actually connected. Like once I can give the responsibility of the tech. to someone and trust that it's in good hands like they'll make it as well as I do is not better, right? Then I can just go very aggressive on, like I can go from like CTO interview calls and managing the tech stack to like. just sales calls and pitches, right? And that's kind of the direction I want to go. Got it. Okay. And so like, how are you running like since October, how are you running the company like in terms of like the cash? Does the company have any cash flow or anything in the bank? No, no. So it's a UK incorporated. It's currently under UK incorporation, but I haven't actually. put in any I haven't actually transferred any money into a bank account. It's just my own burn. So the burn as I mentioned is about 500 per month for our tech provider. a little bit of accounting fees. It's probably like a hundred or two hundred dollars, right? And a month. Is there formal accounting and so on? Not as yet. If a customer wants to pay me, I have an account where I can collect that money. But, and so that would be the, like right now the Android users are on a free drive. So I just get feedback from them. DigitalAlign would be the first paying client. like a C-Corp in Delaware, if we get US investment, right? Which is the route. which is the standard route for Antler and YC. Then incorporating in UAE also has a lot of advantages, primarily tax. If I want, I can even probably collect a UAE investment in the UK. So like a 50% chance of landing an Innovate UK grant, which is... cash injection for no equity but on a reimbursement basis. on a 70% of the reimbursement basis on R&D. So that can just buff up. some additional investment coming in but I can't really take advantage of it and actually Seeing that application through is another 5K invested up. upfront for like legal fees and so on. You can also go around it, but like it takes a bit of work to put together like a 50 to 100 page. application. It's not the worst idea to try that, especially if you have some cash in the back. Anyway, they told me that the team that has actually vetted me has a has secured 90% of all the grants awarded. of like off innovative game right in the last three years. So anyway, so that's a bit of numbers on the... and data on the structuring, corporate structuring situation. Um Yeah, yeah, I think I think I'm leaning more and more towards a US based LCE entity. just because it's like the better place to like collect investment from. rather than a company account and then I can claim against it. Sweet. So covered a couple of questions there. around numbers. You can also talk about like the market. 10 to 240 billion. I didn't come up with this number out of thin air. I tried like at least. And this was the scatter range, right? of them and my conservative estimate is if we actually deliver the scope of what we are promising to be. We are not looking at a market that's anything less than 10 million, even if we don't have the entirety. So that's kind of... I'll also do product management for you, and those kind of things. Gotcha. the figures you get from multiple approaches. So at the end of the day, it's like a, you know, it's a hack, right? But... But there's some method to the madness. Like the signal to me tells me. The signal is very strong that it's an over 10 dollar market. different ways of slicing the pie. Cool, okay, I think this was useful, definitely some stuff for me to think about. I'll try to digest. Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course. I have a few questions. Not to put you on the spot with some stuff that you might need to process. Actually, the net outcome might just be the right prompt for you to think about it as well. So one thing is how are you placed vis-a-vis YC? You know like the YC asks, right? You need to be physically in the US in SF or... three months, right? Starting, what is it going to be? June, right? So when you're looking on YC Founder matching, like... Do you see that? Do you see that as a real possibility for you in the near future? visa-wise, if that was a question, I have the B1, B2 visa, right? So that allows me to stay there for three months. I know people have done that also in the past with YC specifically, It's not about Visa is one thing. The question is more around. How does your life work around that? you got a job with Google right I think YC at some point and I don't know if it's the foo you coming in or once you're through with the program and the cash hits the bank. Yeah, I think that's the thinking that needs to be done. Obviously, I am at Google right now. I am. I think I was semi in that state for the last one year. to be honest, which is when I got on the platform, I think. I genuinely believe that GenAI is the I'm probably preaching to a choir out here, but. But I obviously feel like this is transformative. and will lead to multiple step function. changes in society and the way businesses work and so on. So I have generally been ideating and thinking about spaces to work on. I think it was, I did speak to a few people mostly based sort of India actually about a few ideas and all. I think there was. No strong resonance there. As you said, you need multiple things to align. five of them that are huge and five of them that are, you know. and new companies, so like, you know, if you're the 11th one. you would have wanted to be yet another dot com company from 2003. Just saying. You know, it wouldn't have been such a bad ride to go on. I mean, obviously, risky, right? But in the... And to your point around Jenny, I like that's actually what prompted me to jump as well. So I was having a good time at Amazon. So I'm not like a, you know, and that was actually one of my biggest frustration that Google, which was like. And maybe, I mean, everyone's opinion is their own, but like now. right to like Amazon PM and everything in between and then building the startup and doing all the whatever. My director got a promo and took me through two layers of management. with him to his new team. So one of the reasons I moved was I didn't like the new team, like I didn't want to work in marketing. But the other thing is that in 22 I saw like essentially come out and I cleared with it. I was actually as old as 2019 when I moved to the PGM role because I was basically Right? Release management was awfully painful. This thing you can actually find. to be honest, I'm not even... you look at like Wear OS releases and so on and I would scan for like two or three functions that would actually send data to the server. And if there were any changes on those files or functions. to review the privacy bit. And into that meeting, I would schedule a Google Doc. With snippets of the code of just that changes, those changes, right? in this one hour, right? And that's just one of like some 15 bits. for three different products that I was responsible for. So I was doing this shit all the time, this automation of processes and tasks. I did it for three years. The piece that was missing was natural language understanding. understanding broad context. And so, and I think, I mean, even if I forget program management for a second. I think machines being able to work with free form language data is massive. Boom bubble, call it whatever. Had it not been for... I hate reading. If you give me a 700 page book, I would struggle and suffer, but I can quote. Then in Jan, I flew to US to meet my, you know, Mount View. I told her, listen, I'm going to quit. I'm going to come to the US. In March, I proposed to her. Then I put my papers down, my middle of the year, I was, I basically, I. So I let my boss also know, so I'm in good terms with my boss at Amazon. give you a bit more of a picture as to like where am I coming at it from, right? This is not something I came up with like. like late 20, see it's some, I saw Chajri Preeti and I was like, this is it. Like I need to realign my life. Fair enough. Yeah. But yeah, no, that's OK. So. You've been talking to teams for about a year. Obviously, this is not another team at Google. This is its own journey. Right. And so a few things you might need to think through are like your sort of personal runway and risk capacity and those kind of things. I mean, that would be independent of this, right? So there are like, But I feel more alive than I ever did in my eight years at incorporate. I feel so alive. I don't know if you can tell, but like I'm so wired. and so plug and it feels great. So, So there's the idea piece of it. And obviously you will shape it too. in your own way, right? If you come up, so it's not just it has to be this or nothing. A great co-founder for me would like bring their own sense of direction and a lot of value. But I think there's also a huge win here. Like how many people can I say like I literally lived off their couch going through a breakup like four times. Beyond this competence, I think skills and inclination are also quite... And so I know you've had... And I think for me it's the other way around. Like I can quite competently. wear an engineering hat, but my happy places like product and sales and marketing, right? And so I think the complementarity win is also very high. Right. So I'm very glad you were like the You were like my last, you know, you're not allowed to send like 20 co-founder invites, right? I had said like 90 yeah I'd said 19 I wish you hadn't wasted yours. I mean, wasted, but I wish you could have just... Well, I don't know, but the funny thing is I sent... 90 people the wrong deck 404 link I don't know, maybe it's faded, right? If Nick. who I added here was not out vacationing and like actually I wouldn't even be looking. and start looking around again and then what were the chances, right? those things is that like how do you feel like are they so You spoke about market. You spoke about like what does a product do or program manager do, right? I want to try this, or at least give it one go for like X years. And then if not, then I'll come back in the industry. That's one, but that's a very personal question. My experience is that like you might need to do that independent of the idea like a lot of people tell themselves like I'll if when the right idea comes I'll do it but I think that It's personal, you might have already crossed that bridge a year ago. at Google thinking like I'm looking for my next thing. And then Was it toys or something very unusual? but like you did that but yeah like all in on a startup is a this idea and then there is the idea and then there is the idea opportunity and then there is AskWorkingKilera. If there are things that you have concerns about, let me know. What's your green zone for equity? Let me know. And then you know the YC deadline as well. So I think another thing we need to kind of align on is a some sort of like a decision timeline. Unfortunately, we don't have too much luxury of time here for the YC Redline but we do have a head start. compared to a cold meetup on Viceco. Found a matching in that. happy to. Yeah, it was always fun. Like I actually missed those days in Zurich because. And yeah, it felt more social there than it does in India. I guess there's been lockdown as well, so it's not a fair comparison. So Like for example, this is obviously this is very short-term ism. So don't index your decision on this But let's say very aggressive, but like let's say so. You can actually fly to Boulder and you can meet the 70 founders of these VCs as my co-founder and you'll get comp and you'll get. It's it's pretty crazy. I think it's like he's like doesn't use like Cambridge's or like some team in the UK is developing a sensor. that will be able to detect lithium and these kind of minerals and metals. 40 or 50 million game or take. Dude, fun fact. So I was looking, I was talking to a four. Yeah, the kind of people you meet in thinking. No, I think the questions you also very apt. Um. Yeah, I'm sure you probably thought 10 times also before you. I think 10 times if I move teams within the same company. So yeah, I think once I do something, it's definitely for the long run. But of course, it is something that you want to like. Make sure it's right. I have to definitely mutter where I think like you made this statement about If it's the right opportunity, then you move. And I think that's how I have been structuring my thoughts so far. Like, I didn't want to... quit and then find the right opportunity. Maybe that would be the right way to go about things because that puts you in an uncomfortable zone and forces you to make a decision. Whereas right now maybe, and to be honest, I'm in a comfortable zone, right, given that I... still have a paycheck coming in at the end of the month. Dude, not a comfortable journey. Let's say that is the word. Is this idea? pulling you right and is the pull like strong for it to So that's one that you can kind of answer more in a minute. of your startup opportunities, right? And where you can step in. Is this attractive? So I think that can be answered independently. And then obviously I respect that there is the other question of like, am I ready? Lens is also, this is not my first The number of applications I sent to internal idea review community, AIR or whatever it is. And then I try to actually run it. And I didn't give a shit man, I was too c- Antler and YC nudge you very hard to find product market fit. Yeah. Right. And ensure that you are on some part to success. So Yeah, there's so knowing that right like there is also a thing of like That is a bit of a personal decision of like, yeah, I'm going for it. But anyway. Anyway, I'm just sharing my experience. I think I understand that actually and I had. was fun about that as well, different from my day to day. And actually, like, yeah, right after college, I didn't join Google immediately. In fact, I immediately rejected the offer. I was working on a startup, so a lot of the things, and that was full time, so a lot of the things that we had to. So I was left by myself after the graduate and we started it before itself. So we had a working prototype and well product we launched it in CMU. But then doing it by myself was quite boring and then I was just like, you know. done with it. The six digit paycheck from Google was so stuffed. Say no to after spending three, four months in your own room building stuff. at least as a 22-year-old. I'll definitely think this over and you asked the question in terms of idea where you rank it. I think. It is one of the better ones I've heard, if not. if not the best so far amongst all the people I've spoken to. Not that this is that big, but it definitely ran some there, which is why we're talking for an hour and 45 minutes so far. Is it good enough for me to... or is the magnetic pull strong enough for me to... to potentially quit, I don't know yet to be entirely honest. I think that's the part that I need to like. and do a bit more research and model it. I think model is different because model is once you've done your research. I need to do my own research and understand the space and product scope a bit better. I obviously came through what you sent me yesterday, but now that we've had this conversation. I have a little bit more context and better understanding, so maybe I can. do a little bit more of that to essentially convince myself. that, you know, yeah, because obviously as a co-founder or as anyone joining a company, need to be convinced. for the next five years every single day. So. So yeah, I think that's a process and a journey. And I'll do that research and the thinking. But I'll definitely think about it and read it around a little bit more, understand. If you have other stuff that I can read through that you might have encountered that you have, Happy to do that. I anyway went through everything you sent me yesterday. And that will obviously help. But yeah, I think. that I will do. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And by the way, very reasonable position, right? because it's a like I'm running at the speed in this direction but like That's great. In fact, if you were like... Yeah, let's do it. I'd be like, I'd be worried. It's natural for me to be this way. And it's your reaction, even in the most positive scenario is very natural. So, yeah, that sounds good. I mean, I don't want to rush you, right? At the same time, Yeah, how are you thinking about this week playing out? in the context of a YC application. I don't know if you were looking on. like, you know, just browsing kind of a thing because You had your own idea in mind, right? And you were like actually looking for a co-founder to come build it with so that's that's totally reasonable Right. All you were just kind of checking the lay of the land, right, but. If like let's say, oh, let's go for YC and let's do it kind of thing, then. This might be a bit of the speed to catch up to not not. I don't know if it would look too different from something like this. in terms of like here's a lot of contacts linking through a fire hose, new industry, new market. new team, high risk, meeting lots of people, all that fun stuff. because there are two lenses here. One is. We are a good pairing, right? But the decision timeline for that is not. And that can take a bit of pressure off. At the same time, the YC application is potentially forfeit or not forfeit. apply and both have some confidence that it is the best possible application to make. Again, I want to be able to extend that to you, but I don't want to. put myself in that position. So let me be very clear in and. specific about what I'm trying to say. Like I want to extend. easier path for you into like taking taking on a greater risk, right? So like maybe we can step it. And it makes a lot of sense because that's the journey. That can be a really fucked up situation. I've already lived it, right? So it happened with Antler. And it's painful. It's like... It is very pain and like the thing is the person stepping in can walk away without any, like, you know, nothing changed and they got... to see and experience a few cool things, but like the company putting a lot on the line. I also know Avik is quite aggressive too. What is it, seven days now? Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I was thinking when I, well, I. I guess I've been on the app on co-founder matching for. this deadline in mind. I think maybe you saw me recently at They were online, because I was just skimming through, but I didn't spend that much time on the website, to be entirely honest, just to let you know. Be frank. I think every time you log in, it just says you're recently active or something like that, right? That said, I understand you're obviously eyeing it. You're completely right that I don't want to give you false hopes. I don't think a week I think the question, if I understood correctly, are you basically asking the question that Should we be applying to YC together irrespective of the decision? Is that what you're saying or not really? Or you're saying the opposite. You're saying that we should not be applying to YC together if we're not confident about it. So it's a very good question. I'm just sharing some context here. Like I'm trying to... I do want to go for YSEAL again. I think we have a very good chance, right? Given that as a solo founder, I made it to top 10%. And like I can share my reject email with you. They literally said, please reapply with a co-founder. We don't send this email to everyone. Right. And I mean, getting into Antelope UK is a signal. getting into the UK and US is another signal. So, and I think I'm just looking at it like it could be Techstars, Antler or YC. But like as a startup, I don't think you get a much better start than like one of these sort of incubators, incubators, accelerators, whatever you call them. Not getting it is not the end of the world for me. There are still other paths to funding. But I think not having applied is... would be a pity and I think applying without having acted on their feedback. is also effectively point-based. So I would want to make an application. So that's a bit more of saying like, yeah, I'm a bit scarred, scarred from that experience a little bit. It's completely ruled out that. we've landed full certainty at the time of application. Right. I am actually, like I'm actually open to it. you know, while you develop increase in confidence that This is the right train vehicle, call it whatever, for you to come on to. Yeah, I And then if you get to IC, that's phenomenal. the tricky part would be like, okay, we communicated something to YC. And then we go a different way and then. Yeah, the YC app is also effectively like moved at that point. And By-C still sort of in the future. There's also like an antler piece to it. which is much more current. So I could maybe go through Antler, you know. as myself, as a solo founder. I mean. you started in post investment. I don't know. I like we can obviously negotiate that but like um And I'm jumping ahead, right? Like I think there's a lot of like. But the reason, so I'm actually just. um I'm just because obviously I've had a lot of time to think this through. I'm living this life. like an answer timeline not an answer itself an answer timeline I'm saying this in full acknowledgement of like one week is aggressive. It is very aggressive. But any other good like YC app or anything would Also, and you know, to be fair, like, I would pick a strong co-founder. who I can spend five years working with. Over. just the fact that we went through IC or not. Does that make sense? Right? What's going to make more of a difference? So I have that. context and clarity as well. But I think it would be foolish to not apply to IC, that's one. And then the second thing is that. I think this was a great, wicy idea. six months ago because it was ahead of market. It is a wicy idea today. I think six months down the line or a year down the line, it might not be a... like front of the line in terms of like. Oh, this is something like that. There might be a few more encumbered so they would have seen. Yeah, so I think one thing I'm certain of is I will make the YCR. That's the one thing I'm certain of in the next week. end of next week. But I do want to give you all the flexibility and time to. You can also play with that. The other factor that I'm trying to balance is... Also, I have to also speak to a few other candidates. with that time frame in mind. Now, I'm not going to force a bad decision either. So I had this conversation with myself. uh uh over a very sad beer last saturday when i found out this guy is just innately and all that which is if I have to apply again as a single as a solo founder I would Only 3% of the YC Batch is solo founders, just to give you context. So actually making it to the top 10% as a solo founder. applicant is a pretty strong signal. But also like Yeah, Rio Planets is full of founder, Ethan with a bit of a crack. I'm not doing myself any favors there. I would rather do that than make a bad decision. or go with the wrong. Coming I actually feel quite derisked on most of the things I look out for in a co-founder. Cool, yeah, fair enough. I think, yeah, this makes sense. I'll definitely think about it, as I said. I don't know if I'll have an answer for you in a week, but. We'll keep talking, obviously, and I'll spend some more time just. understanding the space in this area as well. And I think that will also help inform that. So I think other Other factors aside and I think telling Antler aside Right. So Antler is obviously like on is ongoing. I think one thing that we might need to decide on a bit more. urgently is do you want to go for a YC application together? So, okay, here's what we know, right? We know that. not have a definitive decision, right? So let's go in with that assumption. And even if I do, then you should be careful about my thing for coming for greeting such a... major life decision in one week's time. So we know that, right? So given that uncertainty, right? I think that's why I'm putting the question on you. I obviously will also think about it separately myself. But I'm putting the question new whether you want that also or not, right? And there are obviously every permutation combination that is possible from there. One is, of course, the happy part where, yes, I do join. And we work on this full time. That's the happiest part. of IC And then That's a pretty bad permutation. Right, I don't know what that means in terms of YC as well. I do the inject you or something Okay, let me walk us through them. I think. Oh, I don't really care about that to begin with. So soon. the opportunity cost of working with another really good. that co-founder. Yeah, right and building and building. But look, that's going to be true for me independent of IC. Like that's just going to be true in any case. There will always be an element of opportunity cost, right? Those kind of things go a long way. And so to me, that's a part of the package. So I think where I'm coming at it from is I'm actually quite excited about bringing you all. was literally another interview. right, and it got rescheduled. But if this was the only time you had available, I would have. I would have moved it myself, right? Saying like, I'm stuck in something more important, right? So... I don't think it's beyond your capability. So at that point, I'm already assessing for other things. Google did that for me. Google did that assessment form in some sense. I think number one with YC when you apply, they will ask a question. if you get in or like are you working on this full time or something like that, right? it's dead. It's like dead off the bat. Then, We could interview together and we could be. That's fine. We made a strong application and get it. life continues. I will still keep reaching out to other investors. And actually not getting into IC or not getting into. the 10x the valuation, right, with some interest. So that's not out of the ordinary. And actually it is a win in terms of equity. YC is not. It's not the end. And also, what will you do in a group where the average age is 25? Right. So it is a very valuable program, but also like at the stage of our careers, we Yeah, they might nudge to create a clean cap table. because they wouldn't want to invest in a company with dead equity. That's their main thing, right? That's why I just thought it through right now. I'm like, yeah, if you're on cliff and west, it could be manageable. So your question was, what do I feel about it? I mean, I also just had an opportunity to think it through right now properly. The opportunity cost cost I will have to eat anyway That is just the part of the job whether there is a YCR or not. There's a lot of energy to explore a partnership with someone, whether you're dating or whether you're... and you could actually tell me tomorrow like why say I have to chhor do And I used to do your independent research and mull it over and so on, but If we are on track to at least make a YC application, then. and we should act on it. So a few things you'll need to resolve and commit on the... Obviously, telling him, I see that like, yeah, you're insured in. if you're still trying to make up your mind, right? A little bit. That would be another thing. From experience, I can tell you it takes about a couple of hours to work through the application together. Cool. Yeah, I remember doing that 12 years back. Um. Let's connect after that tomorrow or something. Well, I'll tell you tomorrow for me. But yeah. When, yeah, when's good for you? I mean. Get it on calendar. If you don't have clarity, that's fine. That's not saying. But like just just get a meeting time. Otherwise, it will just get it'll slip through and we'll, like I. My Wednesday seems quite packed. No, actually, yeah, let me let me know when it's good for you. Um. I do have a few meetings. I'll try and skip some of them now. We can also do day after night. We can also do day after night. time would be good for you? What I would be similar similar is good. I would say actually I have a Yeah, I I'll tell you what time I can do Wednesday night free. So if I get up at 6 a.m. Maybe that's such a manager for us. Is that I'll give it access in my calendar man, I don't care. Although I guess I can't give it access in my Google Calendar. Not yet. No, this is a blank. Yeah. No, let me just tell you what's the So, India 6.30. is aggressive but can do so okay let's do seven from India to nine right 7 to 9 I could do. What about after 9, I just looking through this, this conversation is going to drag office hours. Okay, this might get too late. So this slot would be... 1130 1130 I'm inclined to say 11.30 India time. Let's put a half hour block for 11.30 India time on Wednesday. And then we'll see. If you can do 11, that works for me too. Half our block at 11 or 11.30, either of them is fine. Just a sec. Cool. Yeah, I'm putting in. a half hour slot at 11. With the understanding that it could become 11.30. meeting, right? So that's fine. As you should and would, any questions or anything? Yeah, let me know. Yeah, I can. I can I can bring that info into the meeting or just respond on like. What's happened? Have I already heard it through or if it's a load of? Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Perfect. sweet. Thanks for your time, Aish. It was super late for you. Appreciate we could make it. But yeah, nice catching up. And still good practice for me to talk through the product and pitch. I swear I've done it like 50 times by now. I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah. Probably at least another 500 more times. 500 more to go, yeah. cut some rest now. All right, see you"
a7fe10ea-ef3c-40ec-a8a2-e4107c49d65f,"That is, I think, like I was reading... people like different startups, ph techs. I feel like us is a little more crowded than an average text. So for most of the part I wasn't following because like a lot of There are a lot of things in one slide I see people have a slide that is like just a few words. I also looked at some YouTube. videos from Sikouya which was advising people to... I looked back into the market. But you guys meant to so I would be happy if we could the review also that So let's not start with the deck, actually start with the ideas. Or what you think are maybe interesting opportunities that we shouldn't. something that I thought of is. The way those like are some of the competitors are structured they're like very their app is also very noisy a lot of options And something that I don't like, I saw people were like not... bunch of people were leaving reviews were like, oh, this is so complicated. Why do we need these many options? For us, when I looked at Marina, I'd... But maybe instead of having a lot of menu option we can just have people use the chat and say oh this is the option that I This is the feature I need could you help me with that and then chat goes like for example In the chat, the person can ask what are the action items and then look at the action items and says, So send number 2, 3, and 4 to JIRA, for example, or open a ticket for those. That makes the app very easier to use. much more user friendly. One thing that I thought that is kind of If you compare ourselves with our competitors and then one other thing I saw a couple of apps that are like very early stage, but They are very similar to something like Spinach IO or Read AI, but they are also integrating with messaging apps and emails so they can you can ask what are all my Way more it could be way more helpful, but then one example that I found We're really early stage. It's not like a. product that people is out there and people use. If we don't over index too much on like AI project management or even note taking. to two month initiator, right? We're kind of talking about where are we going as a company in like two or three years. Oh, boy. I was like, that's the context of what goes inside the pitchfac. That is what an investor gives us whatever X million for Taking a couple of steps back, Pune, is that something that... You know, you have some ideas around it like three four ideas around you are reviewing pitch deck Market is a big part of that equation. Right? Like so for example EI in financial operations. Yeah. The product checkpoints will catch up to it. Right? And so. project management AI, like AI for project management is a significant opportunity. Raise some some sort of money in the next two months. This is like the safest choice if you want to start over from zero is kind of get something in two months. That's what I thought of. Yep, so that is, I mean that is true. with a totally new idea. It Why is that? I know that's like, what is that? YYC that gives you half a million for... Nine percent. So first of all, IC only gives you 125k in cash. The 375K is made available to you. later, right? It's in a safe, it's a safe kind of investment. So it's not like it's yes the amount of figures have gone up right so antler is like I think 200 or 250k one of the two for like 10% If the idea is to actually raise something closer to a million or two million I mean with some more traction than we have right now but we can also get an early check for it. So it's not just like black and white. Anything you raise with any investor is a long conversation. And then you build on that relationship and... So certainly we have a head start, but we can also start with a clean slate. say like we're going after this different opportunity. The advantage of that is. an investor who's looking at a sort of seed stage. style investment. is not going to be biased by the quality of your product. visa via other alternatives in the market. So we have an app that is great. Looks nice, but it is always going to be compared to a read AI. to get to a point where we're somewhat competitive with them or going after a specific niche. But if we can do it, then there's a big check meeting for us. Okay. What I was kind of thinking about. you All right. your Sequoia Capital, JP Morgan, McKinsey whatever have you may write they tend to have like back office teams in India And probably a few other countries now, I'm going to guess that Indonesia is also coming up as a low-cost location. In Europe it tends to be Poland more often than not. So they have a back office in these countries and then they send them like lots of documents to kind of read review summarize Right or generate like PowerPoint presentations And this team in India, essentially they are also employees of McKinsey. But they could be like contracted out by like an intermediate player Extract something from a PDF, right? Let me check it out. Right. I think heavier has probably managed to raise like close to a hundred million if I'm not wrong at this point and Mexico has actually invested in them and they're basically doing a lot of like document intelligence. So there are and then there are a couple more like this but The way to win it is not just the product. On the marketing side, you identify like a use case, right? getting the investor interest as well. So at the technology level, it's still... going after private equity and venture capital firms, for example. And then what private equity and VC firms tend to do. Basically they have people who keep reading these like investor documents. whether they will modify those fun products based on this market intelligence. So that's the way they scale, right? documents and they're expensive as well. They're only half a million paychecks. But they can send it to a cheap team in India, right? where you can have like 50 people who can then read those 500 documents. and then provide the summaries back to the New York team. based on the intelligence that's coming back. So it's a lot of money. This is kind of what I'm saying. And that is a. And there are already examples of financial operations AI companies that have kind of succeeded. So this is a completely new direction. It's not It doesn't have anything to do with such a per se. It definitely has something to do with AI. so are those these companies that are advertising for example will learn your business Those sort of those kind of things Um You AI is gonna learn your business That's what I got from their website. I'm not sure which one are you talking about heavier? Yeah, I have, yeah. yeah, so so the the thing is like Um Pretty quick. Yeah, that's how they are. But yeah something like that. And then also if you look at the... So the founder of a heavy has given some public speeches, right? Does he know how many people has gone that route? when he when he talks about his startup right when he talks about heavier So that's nothing related to us. So they raised 130 million. How did they reach series B? Okay, anyway. When they talk, so he, his whole kind of thing is like when I was seven years old. My dad sat down with a computer and then I was asking him like what is this? Even if Elon Musk comes right Yeah, make a marriage but it maybe makes my I don't know children or grandchildren like make some money for For them they're already making money, that's the whole point. That is why they've raised... They are getting it from investors. Which is what product they are selling today and then there is the core product So the three realities exist at the same time. Vision, the sold product and the actual product. Let me take this. This business cost of yours, right? It's like you talk you were to offshoring right off during jobs for like like services and so on in the US. So now companies can not offshore jobs and basically have AI do it. while still in the US. So basically, you might think that like... You know these McKinsey consultants are doing some like rocket science thing. No, they're just like In fact, at Antler, I met the McKinsey partner who started you Yeah. Okay. I think he started this company Yeah. And oh, I didn't know that they got 200,000 top students. yeah, the website is already they They sell experience too. What was the thing about that happier You mentioned that he got to the idea because his... I missed that part. It's just... It's just... Let me let me come back. I'm yeah, yeah. I got that. Yeah, so the financial industry, actually our clients might themselves be like essentially different VC firms right so I already know like business in India Where they are basically talking to like a few different VCs, right? So Lightspeed Ventures, and they also have contacts in Sequoia. What they're doing is they've got 30 people in India who just take the monthly investor reports. from the Tier 2 colleges in India, right? And they're just reading and maybe some Tier 1 colleges as well and they're just reading these reports every day. I mean, I think honestly, it's not a bad experience for like 2-3 years. You do it and then you learn so much and then you move on to something bigger. But coming back, they get paid a lot of money and all this work is manual. And they have a 2 million. They're looking at a one to two million budget to just build an AI. At the tech level, it is document extraction. Right, but you are talking to the right people who have a lot of money to solve and go after a problem. And then in the long run, like we can start working with like banking clients and start doing like back office operations for them. So that's like the market roadmap, right? Like how does the market keep growing? How do we go from like making our first million to making 10 million to 50? 500, right? And then when we make our first million. like an investor is going to be very happy to give us 20 million. investment right on a 20x multiple right so it's so investor on the post sort of traction stage but with profiles like ours, we can get the angel check for it. As you mean that like we're clear that this is the direction you want to go in and then you have a story that is powerful, and we'll construct that story. So, Phenopsis here could be like one bar to go down. Then I want to show you something that we should put together, which I think is actually pretty... Smart. So this is, I can just share the link with the two of you. I think like rishit's kind of gone above and beyond I just asked him to share like a few ideas with me But it's cool. I think he's been, you know, this is this is. Classic like Krishit. Um multi-million dollar idea right just that So now, Prakriti will understand this. BORRICK But in India, there's a company called Tracto. And they're filling out all the details. So in that 30-minute consultation, 15 minutes is just the person wrestling with the details. The doctors are talking to you and everything that needs to be updated. Good Very good at this. Yeah. I normally go to the. Their website and the chat pod gives me the answer Good and R. So it's GoodRx. They are a They are brilliant company. Their engineering interview is harder than... Google and Meda and all of those I'm sure. A lot of times I wanted to schedule with the doctor for a 30 minute call. I just went there and My problem was solved. Makes sense. Makes sense. Okay. we can come back. It's a little hard to get to the chat bot and like their website is a little bit. Oh Lord, what not that hard honestly, they're also they're also selling like Oh my god. They And like in terms of how your body processes it. And it's the new cool thing for Hollywood to abuse because you just have it and then you're you lose weight, right? So I think the guy... this like healthcare abuse in the US because that's just Two or three Like opioid epidemic happening like opioid crisis in the US happening all over again and it hits like middle-aged women in... arguably unhappy marriages or so they tend to talk about it culturally right the worst anyway So three kind of directional ideas, right? We can also review things at this level. Okay, I didn't know that so it kind of the meeting often to me as a surprise. That's why I'm kind of... lagging a little behind. I didn't know we are... We are open to deviate that far. it. Yeah, I didn't get it. If you had any of the cuff, let's say you have a pretty talented team around you and you wanted to just chase after this goal of yours. like or some like if you could just start up or pitch to What are two three things on your mind and like maybe why? Table dog like I kind of wrote that down at some point one of the things as far as I remember I can go reach my nose but One of the things that I was thinking is... going to work very well is collecting data. There are companies that are just collecting data as it's... They are not supposed to be profitable as soon, but since this... Other than general things, whatever is online. and they have access to the rest, they're like lacking I don't know what it is doing right now. I used to work at their competition. Yeah, Kaggle has a data sets product that is like. Very popular look. you Um Anyway, OK, I want to be mindful of. So let's maybe get Prakriti's ideas. When it comes to like clean state, I think I quite agree that like, yeah, there needs to be like a repositioning. But I also think that it's like that cringe thing of like don't look for a problem, right? Like if there's an actual problem solved with. And I feel like the premise of such of like this whole thing of obliterating admin, I think. You actually do have like a spike in it because you have actually been in that role So I feel like instead of deviating like immensely I feel like even in that space, there's like a lot of particular like niches that we for VCs if you want them to invest in the team then it's kind of like Here we are, we've never worked in finance, but like... Exactly, that's what I mean. The first thing, you have to find another co-founder that is kind of experienced in that area. Which I'm very open to so let me start there right now. I'm not I'm not But that's another two months process. It doesn't get so my And one more time I want to clear that out. I'm gonna paid in two months. If you want to, Pune, if you want to optimize for like you know like our velocity and success in two months then You should really try and make more of the like. Like the week right so like this prompt for like let's put ten ideas on a board right is something that I think I mean sure we could have like clarified I don't think I accept that maybe you didn't Have full clarity on like what level were we discussing? Yeah, this is also not just one week of your time, this is one week of my time, Prakriti's time, Avik's time, Rishit's time, Derek's time, right? So I'm also aligned in making sure that we get some kind of like. So it's like things that are like very intense like phases. like that right in the journey of a company I'm not using what for sure, right? And then we reach out to like. Then we need a list of investors, maybe 200, of which we reach out to them in batches of 50. on like a weekly basis and then we look at So you know how when you were talking about, I'm sorry, this is like derailing from the like, So when we're thinking of positioning, right, so. This thing is like automated. Yeah, so automating meetings and things like that, right? So I was thinking there's two possible things. The first thing is like like you know how Duolingo works, like this whole thing of just like creating a nut system. So I think that. If let's say because the notes thing I think already exists, but I think the second part of this that you said was, oh, you don't have to follow up, right? You don't have to like. do the following up, I feel like that's a part that's less. kind of like focused on by all of these like not taking out something like that. So let's say if you If we do the same thing that we're doing right now, like integrating with Jira, et cetera, et cetera. first getting to the action items. I know that this is a bit, this might be a bit annoying because the product that we have right now is more focused on the first part. like from the little that I understand of it. So basically, we don't even need to solve everything for everything, like Zoom and Slack and all that. People literally told me to just do the Jira integration and we'll buy. So generally aligned with you. To me, this is a, so if I come back to my rubric here. Right? No, I shouldn't call it a rubric, whatever. Going down the Satyapalak means We stay on the such a path. means v1 stays as my nodes v2 And then the rest of the deck. We can keep a lot of the elements there, but we say that in like. And we have a good chance of raising funding as well. So. Obviously, the technology that exists right now is not perfect, but I'm wondering if there's... I'm not sure if that's like super appealing as we want. I'm wondering if there's like any other aspect of it that we could be focusing on. So for example, if you already have So like if we look like if we look at the whole thing of like creating systems where like, I think what you said initially was that. There was some kind of project and the whole thing was that if these XYZ things are not done then a meeting will auto We can automatically be scheduled with XYZ people. So I'm wondering if We already have all these companies, right, but millions of ARRs. If we can create those customized systems for those. you and just like get the thing that we have a product in use. And I know that you've done it before, so I'm maybe underestimating how much work. the product requires. But Can you talk about like a, just talk about an example specific. feature specific so that So for example, if there's Like, I think... If there's five people in a team who kind of need to, let's say, get done with XYZ number of documents. and they have like three steps to it. And the idea is that if... all of them are not done by, like they have to be done by a certain date. But if they're not done, then a meeting kind of needs to be followed up, kind of needs to be scheduled with the program manager. or if xyz number of tasks are left undone. by, you know, XYZ team member, the program manager for us needs to be with XTech, whatever team member, like that kind of thing. If we mix that with like a little bit like if we term it as like oh my god like the Yeah, So basically, at a feature level, what you're talking about to me is like, burn down tracking escalation. And then basically all of this. boils down under execution risk management. That's what's this. At a product level, this basically still boils down to certain integrations. Where are you tracking the burn down? Not everything that is happening is going to be discussed in a meeting. Some of it is going to sit on Docs, some of it is going to sit on. So we're going to need to build either I am totally okay if we never publicly launch my notes. Don't say this to all the Englishers, they'll be extremely demoralized. But actually now it's on record. But. We shouldn't build my notes as a complete V1, right? There is an ocean of an internal launch and an external launch and it would be an internal launch an extremely useful checkpoint for us to even start exploring like some of the other ideas here. So that's Kind of number one. I also want to make sure I don't lose this train of thought here. You mentioned previously that like. Look, we don't have expertise in like. finance for example I can tell you that the bar for expertise in finance is much lower you're not going to get nowhere. And then there is another compliance. And that compliance is going to kill you. The absence of that compliance is just not going to let you do business. in the US and if you try to do business in the US without a HIPAA compliance the founders go to jail. So just, you know, it's a... That It's easier Here you can't get away from the medical qualifications. At least someone in the team, right? Or we pay. a partner organization, a certain amount of money to kind of approve our work. Coming back to one thing that you mentioned, Pune, which was around like. Oh, what if we have mostly a chat-focused application? For the bot to be able to say things like I cannot do that in it. And so we need to make sure our AI has a way of understanding that. That's not that hard. plus AI, it's not just AI by itself. So there are like certain questions and it goes to the decision tree and... comes back with the answer. Those types like that we don't have a son or those things could be good under decision tree. Okay, so just to use this time when I don't want to keep Prakriti much longer. Yeah, I think it's past her. Yeah, I want to just review the latest. We don't have to go slide by slide, Prakriti, but did you? I have not because I think I was just one. I was waiting for like. the as we discussed with the positioning. Also just on that front a little bit. Wait, where was I? So based off like. like what? Grant so like in order to claim half a million you need to spend 800k Also, one more thing that I think we talked about last time was the emotion detection thing that you were talking about. in case we're still discussing. on that, I think just. Again, I think it's more about the marketing. So even if it's just a note-taker, even if it's my notes. I feel like it might be helpful to just in general connect an industry to it. Thanks. Read AI does emotion detection. They're like, oh, you are like. You know, you were talking like this way that way. I mean emotion detection is a broad space but Ocean detection for project management? Yeah, that's fertile. Like we haven't gotten into that yet and we can bring that Okay, so taking a step back, right? Like just assuming that we're going to be on such a right. Right. And yeah, I'm happy to move things around. So there is some feedback on the like, should we Talk about the value first. Should we make it less dense? Actually, we should work backwards from a timeline. So what is a good timeline? So if you want to raise in two months time. then we should dispatch in my opinion. which requires us to have a pitch deck ready in like two weeks off which I think saying one week is a lapse is very aggressive. So like. we need to have a clear pitch deck in a week or two, right? And then, and then. dispatch to a list. So that's kind of my... And I think, yeah, and then we can let people know what our investment timeline is. So that's kind of... Just one more thing on that. So I think... Right, like based off, again, this is very limited because I have not done this for long. at moralized based on the terms? It would not be angel investment. It would not be a seed investment or a pre-seed investment. Yeah, I think that overall it might be worth reconsidering the like. So we're hoping to raise within two months. I'm a little bit Unless we have a product that's like, unless we can like. You know really like experience like that whole thing relying on the network already and just really going at that. We need to kind of agree on the approach you're taking. Um Okay, I mean, but Pune you should know that like if we're gonna chase in west angel route right really developing, right? We don't have a launch product, nothing like that. on for another month or two which means that at the time that the email or the pitch deck hits the investors inbox. We don't have a public product, right? So we're realistically looking at like 200k. Realistically, right? And yeah. Right based on your kind of like financial needs as well. So we can have a conversation on the back of that but What's like the... quickest possible thing. Who don't know what are the costs associated with it, but it's kind of ready. We can all go and Kind of have it on our own local so do that. So why is it some kind of complex It's not a complex process. You can deploy it. And If my life like if lesser we just change the logo to my notes Is it possible to have it there by next week? my opinion it is but I don't know I was thinking of, yeah, I'm going to just... Go ahead and deploy myself. He's not around since he's not around. You can present that update, right? Like look at this right here. And I have the GoDaddy like. domain mapping, right? So once you... So whatever you deploy on, let's say you deploy on. App Engine. Give me the. Oh Yeah, give me the routing details for that App Engine instance. So I'll read out my dot.net, that thing. So that's just like, that's going to take me three minutes, right, to just. in the link, but the deployment work is still kind of pending. So yeah, feel free to deploy it. It's not like. It's a big deal for Avik, right? Because he's probably not deployed. you can read that. I didn't know what's hard there. document your steps so that in the future you can just ask a VK and Rishabh to redeploy rather than it being something that you have to do every single time. But yeah, like, but and so, uh, And then we should take a call on whether we should say like my notes is Because just because there is a domain called my.notes doesn't mean that Yeah, we should deploy it. We should play with it. Like what happens if someone just goes to my notes, right? Are they? The fun part. Permissions, authentication. So yeah, I mean, like if we can deploy it, then that's great because that's a huge advantage for us in terms of what we put in our pitch deck for this invest of last. for me to give you a such an account and for you to be able to use the app. for you to be able to log into the such a website and actually use it. So we have only 100 accounts we can do that for before we have to go through a review with Google to make the app public. And the review is a security review. So they need to see our accessing their calendar, accessing their email, those kind of things. So Google does not let just any willy-nilly developers. launch something and then start advertising to all Google Gmail users saying, here's your data. There's a review process we need to go through. We can even invite them, but we are limited to 100. Sorry for interrupting. Just wanted to like... Close the loop. Think about like such a positioning overall is still like open because if you don't want to focus on the my notes part then I think it may be like in a different conversation if we can all have some thoughts. I'm wondering if we should use like. Tuesday's call to reconvene because a week's not going to make it anyway So on the dev side, it's going to be relatively light. outside of the outside of an update from like Russia Actually, Richard, Derek, I'm not sure. Pune, are there going to be significant engineering updates on the Tuesday meeting? about there are like direct stuff that is... I need to be figured out some permission that I wanted to talk to you kind of offline. I'll ask it to you. Also, I'd prefer if it's not. This Tuesday just because I might have some other. Okay, okay. chase down like a meeting time for us. It can also be like if the next best slot is next. We can then let's do that. That's okay Um. Yeah, but it would be just the three of us or. Don't get me wrong. We don't have a, you called it spike, but. already. But yeah, if you have like doctor friends. Who are looking to start off for whatever reason and are looking to join our Right, who are kind of bored of like talking to patients or whatever. Then sure, let's talk. 25th 25th 25th is what day? put in that preview as well. Okay, I will just set no. too. Okay, I'll just send you guys invites to that and then. So, Prakriti, can you do me a favour? Can you just send me the latest pitch deck? Even without the changes. It's just in it to me, right? What I'm gonna do is... you Having these discussions. of the back of a program, it's leveraging like relationships, right? Friend of a friend, friend of a friend. So I just need a latest which tech. Right. which has Pune in and I can then I'll edit this and I'll use it to continue those conversations. Right, so it's just going to be easier for me to just make like the appropriate edits. It's not going to be the perfect pitch deck. I'll make a copy of it and use it for my purpose, right? Um Yeah, maybe we can reword it. Maybe we can highlight the fact that. We are doing emotion detection and so on right so I'll Like how does this sound and how does that sound because that makes for a more effective meeting right so you actually review some content talking at each other in some way, right? I'll make a copy of this. I'll start using it to talk to the investors I'm talking to. or continue talking to the investors I'm talking to. And then we should have a... So there needs to be an agreed date when we actually start doing the outreach. in terms of raising. The FOMO is what gets you the money. So you don't create FOMO by reaching out to 10 investors, you create FOMO by reaching out to 300. and letting those investors know, listen, you're nothing to me. with an outbound investor, we need to have clarity internally. Yeah, and definitely with like some FOMO and all that. think I'm gonna have that much time to kind of go through the dark. Till then. like it's cool. OK, cool. They help. Thanks guys, bye. The Firestore export didn't work. says Import-Export Admin Access, but I'm not admin for anything. That's what I read and like. Plus I tried to give him access to. this bucket but it was apparently the plan is limited. interesting interesting okay, let me take a look Um set. you you Thank you. I also need to jump out. Take that offline. Yeah, so in the roles that I can share with you. I don't think there is an admin one. So admin one is probably Database admin, yeah database admin is there. So let me actually just search for Firestore. Okay, Cloud Datastore Scheduler, Cloud Datastore Backups Admin. all of them one by one myself and it's going to be a very Is this the loop, right? It should not be that difficult if like it should be like one line of Python. to export the whole thing to your disk. Because we don't have that much data. It's not even going to be like 200. We don't, but there are like underneath thing. would have had he would have to do that anyway. doing For engineers and it's okay. I'll do that. No, no I so I think the best thing here is let me just Add Derek and give him editor permissions. That is the right thing. I do not know. Tell him to be careful, right? Because he can do some damage. Um Cool. So Derek has admin permission. Derek has editor permission. Okay. Yeah, which if you're deleting your cloud project and moving things back and forth. So I don't think it's like a permission you can just. I mean, Datastore, this specific one, I can probably share. Let me see this one. But if it's solved for now, like we can. Yeah, it's solved for now. That's the best way of doing this because... Yeah, yeah, cool. That was it. Cool. So yeah, let's, so I'm going to, I'll. And. Yeah, I'll do the investor outreach But yeah, we can make fun that works for everyone. We can do it over two raises, it's just that our equity has diluted a bit, but that's fine. I'm going to discuss this further. I wanted to talk to you about the other thing that I'm doing. What's okay sure when is that by the way? When are we catching up next? Next time the same So do you want to lose like another week? Right like I'm not I'm not gonna be able to raise two million for you. This is like the level of engagement. By the way, I don't have a problem with it. I'm just saying Two months is not going to work, right? How is it going to work? We're going to talk like six months. I love spread around my I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you want to just agree on a time you want to meet? That I'm happy to do that right happy to have that conversation Like, I'm actually asking you like, when do you want to meet next? So. If it's going to be next Saturday, that is OK. Every time after my nine is going to work for me. or I don't want to go out to a hundred investors. saying Pune is our tech co-founder only to have you go on a different direction. Yeah, exactly. That's why I think we have to definitely get to some point. So the smart way to do this is The smart way to do this is like pick something go all in for two months and then maximize your chances of success there. Okay, now if you want to do two things at the same time, right, I think definitely one of them should not be a founder opportunity. the thing that I wanted to happen. While they are not raising money, it is possible. It's Right? Nobody wants that. No. When I'm when I'm assessing the odds. I know it is risky and I know you're optimizing for your success and all that and I respect that. That's fine. that we should be doing if you want to come in as a co-founder. You Something for two months. I don't think anyone is so I mean I asked you like what That's why, something that I misunderstood, because... Definitely the f-"
aa3c8df4-a868-4785-ac4e-6681cff60a21,"And we can actually even switch into Hindi. So I think it supports like anything like languages. I mean changing a transcription provider is relatively easy that's also a crowded market now. So there's like anywhere between like eight to eight to 10 to pick from. And I got a may hindi about time just assuming you speak hindi. Are you available? So if you're also in the same organization, I have access to your. calendar and it has access to mine. So what would a program manager do? Right? It will find that take the agenda from this meeting, pre-populate it, right? And then over the course of the meeting it will track like what are the things that you've covered? What are the pending things? Just make sure we get to the end of it. Now there are some very template or like very structured meetings. like for example, scrum meetings. So those lend themselves really well to full automation. The decision makers in any org are typically like more often than not like product managers and engineers, right? Program managers do make decisions, but they're typically around like scheduling, like timing. But a good PM and a good Eng manager are also in a really well position to do that. So a lot of the value addition is like 80-90% of the role is just like a lot of administrative. So I'll just quickly change. presentation mode and I'll just show you another screen of mine, right? So at the end of the meeting, you get something like this. This is a chat I had earlier. And then there's some key meeting moments that it's picked up and highlighted. with you. Now, I have all this data in the backend. So I have the data for the transcripts, but... Interestingly enough, how is this different from an app like Fireflies or AI? meeting transcription tools. Sorry? yeah, Gong is killing it. Gong is... So their focus is on typically on like. Sales and yeah, sales marketing. There are also specialized apps that handle things like recruitment. And that's the niche I want to go after for a variety of reasons. So I don't want the tool to be like a strong decision maker. I think this like AI product manager and AI. In terms of updating internal tools, there is more tolerance there. And then obviously there are people in house that are in the driving seat of like How do you want to tune it and deploy it? So let me see if I can bring that up here. In terms of the vision and the roadmap. You are you didn't mention you're getting into tech stuff, right? So this is an assignment I put together for like CDO hiring earlier, but actually the interesting This is here. every conversation that's happened around it in a single place, right? And it's a searchable. Data store and if you want that to be notion, then that's great. I can definitely do that for you and then we can support multiple. So I have a vendor as well. So they've got some very good APIs, also a YC startup actually. in terms of Zoom, Google Meet, Slack Teams, and I think now they also support Cisco WebEx. and they have WhatsApp and Telegram on their roadmap. So in terms of communication portals, we are covered. a lot of these transcription utilities are not doing right. And that's sort of the enterprise play here. So for any company that I integrate with, I want to ingest the entire project database. Right, so you can just chuck your three or four like Google Drive folders at me or like your entire notion at me and say, look, this is the history of our projects. The employee database. So you could be using Workday or something. So we get a graph. of the employees. And then for all the conversations, I have the live context of this meeting. but then all the others that have happened before it. Aggregated are these various. life cycle of the project, tasks, like what task is being spoken about. right in any given in any given moment or in any given time. or what series of tasks are being spoken about. Is it existing? Is it new? That's just a straightforward integration roadmap, right? like a L2, L3 engineer can just hook it up to different APIs and just. Again, integrations, like how do we create pipelines to ingest that data? But it's actually very similar to what you're doing, which is how do I structure it? Like once I have all this data lake. and this tranche of data coming in. How do I add scale? Make sure that I build the world's best sort of intelligence in terms of. product makes, right? Which is booking the next meeting. So not just like accurate like, oh did I get the transcription correctly? I mean, that's just the beginning of the, you know. the journey right but their context rich like obvious is And any check would be anywhere between like 50,000 to 100,000. Your different roles do a lot of project management work, right? So they're actually at a very low price point doing a lot of automation from them across the org. And so for me, the North Star is actually I'm not doing anything with it at this point in time, but the idea is I want to get very good at mood detection. tone detection, those kind of things. So if there's a particular person and like soft spoken right but they seem very tense in a meeting Just like a smart, emotionally intelligent project manager would do. So some advantages, we can obviously, it takes about three to six months to train a project manager, we can get. limited memory, right? They can run five or 10 projects at a time. We can deploy this across the organization. pretty quick. The other thing is that there are some like very structural advantages. in the morning can get a summary saying like, hey, these are three things you should work on today. And at the end of the day, if you've been in like, let's say seven meetings, right? It's a lot, right? And you don't even remember what the second meeting was about. So you can get a summary. all the actions that you want to pursue downstream. All right. And at a senior management level, Right? Like, you have a constant. context of like what the hell is actually happening in my company beyond just what Jira tells you. So what is the true status of a project? What is genuinely at risk versus, because in a lot of ways the product is. omnipresent. And so I think in terms of the potential for AI, like and the potential for the value that the product can unlock. Going after project management, program management is a sweet spot. It's also not too high stakes as like a. Oh, this is your sales agent now. This is your product manager who's going to decide. what the company is going to do for the next three years, right? It's broad enough that it actually aggregates enough value. across the industry, but it's still very specific. It's specific enough to be a Funding I'm looking for all of that that's in the deck a few interesting developments right now So you heard of Micromax in India right? Micromax the guys who are making the phones it's like 3 billion ARR So we're talking to the managing director of Micromax. They are quite interested in it. We've not actually gotten to a point where But that's sort of like one level, one channel. I've also had conversations with representatives from the AI Councilor of Abu Dhabi. and they want us to basically build it for their government people selling the tech to other Gulf countries, right? So they want to sort of be like early adopters in that sense. Early stage conversation, I have spoken to a person who can open doors for me. But, you know, again, we are pre-product. Definitely there's a working prototype here but as one developer there's only so far you can go. top 10 in like on product hunt those kind of things right but like I mean, those are as valuable as they are, right? Like you have users, the reality is I'm still waiting for my first check. Right, so whether it's an investor check who's willing to bite. Customers are willing to pay money. My issue is that So we have a pricing page and everything. My big issue is that like I So getting customers through the door is not the hard thing. getting someone to write me an advanced check so I can actually grow out the team. And then actually get the product to that stage like three or six months down the line. IT Delhi, spoken for two months. And then he got cold feet like I'm not gonna get my UK visa and all that so he backed off Dude, the amount I'm shipping like he wasn't able to get to like even you know, like three commits of code and I was already racing like through the the products like this is not gonna work Because at that time we were talking about like an equal split as well, which is which is totally fine, right? But then the contribution need to at least be, I was still doing all the business and I was still building more product than him. There was another conversation that physical. So I've been on this passive lookout for a co-founder. Can you work together and so on? And then if it doesn't work out, that ends up screwing you even more. It's a no and there's nothing good people right, but the problem is three months is extremely costly and the opportunity cost is also very high. And so it's a competitive market. Whether you get involved with this or you go do something else. I can just give you a heads up that the AI services space is ruthlessly competitive, right? Like it's brutal. And so yeah, next, being able to build a product quickly enough is a challenge. I was sharing something about YC. A month ago, I was extremely dejected to see that they I don't know if the company they invested in which is an XYC company that are trying to do the same thing now but Like should I do like, you know, 15 investor reach outs a day? or should I spend like 12 hours coding right because with There's a lot more ground you can cover when you have like five or 10 engineers working in a team, especially with an enterprise product. which is spinach is also going after a utility. Right. And I don't think they figured out like the the Jira, Monday, Asana integrations yet. With me, it's a high context product. So actually, ingesting your company database and making sure that, like the vision is like you should be able to ask these questions. Like what is the status of the project? And at least at a technical level, I have the infrastructure. to be able to answer that. So I can process that in 10 seconds, check the rag. And that's what other tools are not doing, right? Either they're building a chat interface and it's an offline product. You don't want you don't need to hire project managers anymore, right? Like it will book the next meeting it will figure out what is the right next thing to do if we talk about like kicking off a project. I have and understanding of that as an entity and then determining the ability to determine that. this structure needs to be put in place, right? And these cadence of meetings and documentation around it. Those kind of things right so I think they haven't come around to like that vision PCI So the current CEO of YC was a guy called. Gary, it's a guy called Gary Tan and Gary Tan. Okay. So, Book face it looks and there's not much here, but just But they've got a lot more resources, right? And they've got a head start. So one of the things that also pissed me off when I saw that okay Strong words, but so you know, you know, there's a product called Kata book product, I forget his name now, but I was talking to him December Jan. and they wanted our product, agreed on the pricing. I Really? Yeah, SID. I'm just SID. I don't know them directly. The from our backs. But then they were like, OK, well, we have this gap and this product is perfect. So got into almost were closing a deal and then their lawyers like taught me to read last minute They were like, look, if you send them your data, you're going to lose your ISO 27,000 certification. So they got certified and then obviously we are not ISO 27000 certified yet I thought WANTA was a lot cheaper than getting it done otherwise. We won't just get ISO, right? We'll also need to... So HIPAA obviously can come later, but like ISO and SOC 2 are non-negotiable and it's 15,000 plus 5,000 for every certification you get in your one. And then thereafter renewals, I think are like 5,000 a piece. 40,000 for the certification but yeah year one it's going to be like 20k. I mean I'm sure I could negotiate with them. I don't It's not the sprint. Yeah, they do our stock too and I think we do have 27,001 as well. But our customers in the US are more worried about software then. I think I use 27001 is more like a European thing. Americans about right about software and I think these guys do we were doing so to type one and then we move to software type two and we get it done by sprint up seems affordable so far nobody's complaining I don't know what the exact number is but I see your point Yeah, it's one of those classic need money to make money kind of situations. It's stealing problems, right? Like I right now I'm like I don't want to market the product because I don't need ten more people telling me they want the product yesterday like I'll be very happy if I can get to a point of, I can bring the product to a point of majority with like one of them. Which is also interesting Oh, actually not too too much like at the moment my cloud bills and everything are like close to slightly south of that like maybe 750 or something So it's not nothing too crazy. But yeah, I mean there's another challenge, right? So some people want to try it for free So you have like a 200 person organization now one cost I have for the product Because I'm not just doing meeting notes. I mentioned the audio video real time. feeds and the recordings and everything, right? So one hour of using the product at this point in time cost me a dollar. 30 dollar 30 give or take right so if you if so You know that feeds back into the pricing if you're a single person, right? Let's look at the B2C model That's going to run me up a bill. Because it's linked to my credit card. That's still OK. I think that the challenge is a bit more. testing it. That's, it's all achievable because I've worked with like a You know at Google Amazon and all I've worked with like 15 20 like engineering teams anywhere upwards of like 15 people strong. So the Google fit wearables team I was talking about was like at any point of time like 20 to 40, 45 engineers. So those are programs I've managed. And then, and like, I know with a dedicated team like that, like this is. a year to get to a very solid product and about six months to get to a viable product that you could deploy to at least a couple of. more understanding clients, I guess, right? But yeah, I can't pay six people's salaries. And so I do need a seat check or a customer who's willing to commit those resources to us, something. Yeah, it's that like it's that chicken and egg thing and yeah at this point I'm like Yeah, thinking about like, you know how to how to kind of proceed further. I mean, additional marketing is not the right way. So I've kind of paused. development, I'm like talking to investors. I think co-founder is the big With being a solo founder, like 98% of the doors are going to be shut. Anyway, of the ones that return your calls. and a few others right across all three continents right so like you got like a selection of like US investors, UK based investors and so on. But yeah, like the general feedback is you're a bit early. And it's the same in Android, like a little bit early. So yeah. The first check that we got after YC was from a guy called Parker Conrad. founder and CEO of a company called Rippling. It's very large. I don't know, 14-year dribbling or something of that. We worked very closely with Parker. Before we started the company when he and I used to I honestly I'm not dejected by the experience I know the game right they want to see And also like the world of ECs has also evolved, right? So like five years ago what it took to get a check versus today. And then between that, the next check is typically like, oh, you have traction, right? So you've got paying users and now they're measuring revenue. which can work if you're going after very, you know, like. focused products but like this is a substantial product undertaking like even opening I write like before they came out with charge EPT they were in incubation for like Who was it like seven or eight years and they went like bankrupt and lost? I'm not saying we're open here quite yet but my point is when you're building substantial product right like this is not a trivial product you can hack together I mean it's But yeah, I mean, like what we're trying to build is a lot bigger. So getting there without a check is... What do you think is the risk of getting to the MVP and then realizing nobody wants this? Very valid question. So I would say that I don't think in six months we'll get to like this like magical AI program manager that does it all. That's, I mean, that's, that would be like foolish, right? So my sales targets for the end of the year are not like. Oh, I have like 10,000 users. Actually, it's just I have five companies that are using our product and each of them are going to be very specialized deployments, right? So there's a core tech stack that's built, right? And then we do some quality control. in terms of the suggestions it makes and so on. But the reality of how it's going to manifest in different enterprises is going to be very business specific. And only when we have done gone down a roadmap of like 5, 10, 50, 20 customers. And I want this very specific thing to happen when it's in a meeting. I've had a CEO come to me and say like, I can't be in every meeting in my org, but I want an overview of what's going on and nothing gives me that. Like an overall overview of what's happening in the meetings across my org. So that's another entirely different use case. So the idea is to get to adopt the core technology, but then let them define like what are the features they want and get it to a get it to I mean, Get it to a point where it's like, you know, there is enough value That is an ongoing relationship. There is enough product value that is being delivered to them on a recurring basis and our costs are covered. for a certain period of time. And I think we'll get to a point where we are like a productized solution, like a fully productized solution. That's going to take like three, four years. You know, you just get to a website. Check check check right like oh, I'm using notion. I'm using G rights in and it's basically like a magical project management experience. I mean, that's going to take some getting to. So for me, the goal is for any like, so there are these interesting conversations, right? You've got Buku, Varun. In the US, I think like one major client. who signed up for our waitlist and emailed us a couple of times. This is American Sleep Apnea Association. Right. So they do like about close to 2 million. And I mean, it's a It's a donations based business, but they have 2 million of cash flowing every year. by taking that and it's the same with project management as well right like a lot of the realities of the job are very domain specific and then we get to a point where we can sort of synthesize. crystallize the... So I have a product roadmap, but I don't want to build the entire product roadmap if I'm taking the investment. Yeah. It kind of does, but I'm also wondering if, so I'm trying to think of it as like. internally if I were you know if I were to Let's assume that we don't really have program managers as such in Synaptic. Most of our meetings are in person. I'm trying to think if... We were a remote first org, we could actually have these meetings. Who do you select to within the org? And in my head, it sort of feels a bit like I'm obviously. on day one. But I think there's a lot of value in something that's extremely specific for one user. who would typically have the authority to pay for it right. So if you're talking about like in my head the model I have is let's assume the CTO is the guy who has the budget for it. And he's the guy who basically takes the call. He has the usual bank framework. You have the budget, you have the authority, and so on. So let's assume he has both the budget and the authority and he has like sort of the urgency to use something of this sort. The urgency there would be In my head, less of a catch-all situation and more of... example of like RCT, right? It was one of the co-founders. He has this issue every time Anybody in any of these meetings anytime anybody in product? does engineering, he has a huge problem with it. So for example, then... and he sort of wants to be he wants to know the second any product manager tries to tell any of the engineers what the tables should look like that's not your problem and do this one thing for the guy who is the CTO who has both the budget and the authority to pay for it. would also probably make it like a little simpler for you and something that is super But I'm sure that's probably something that you must have already considered. So So, first, the use case I have in mind is Scum. Scrum is a very like, I mean, it's a planet wide thing. You get up to Jira. The Scrum Master role is gone. It's not a program manager quite yet. It's a very entry-level project management position. And a lot goes into it, right? So there's setting up the LLM that I can connect it to a Jira right now. But the issue is it will just do garbage entries, right? So I need to source some data, I need to train the model, deploy the stack. So that's actually the tricky part. The one use case that I've actually gone for, so I do mention in my deck, I've got 13 users. So what I did was when I was at Antler, You can sign up and use this for your customer interviews and I'll give you a summary of your discussion. But I also added this one extra check, which is, did you pass the mom test and when? query for me. It's like, it's not right. So We can do a lot of it real time. You can also do it retroactively. It's not hard. The data is there. It's just a matter of running the query. You tell me what intelligence you want. But I do want a client who's willing to pay for it. So, additional intelligence, additional analysis that is quite honestly cheap. Now I totally understand your view on like, okay, why don't you take one use case and productize the hell out of it? So Scrum I told you it's still a significant undertaking and then Utility is like the mom test already so many like for example recruitment interview screening meeting bots. That's not a That's not a... I can see how it works as a product. But it's not a... how do you call it, a distinguished product. Then even for customer discoveries and interviews, I did find that there are some tools that are purely designed for a customer discovery interview meeting. So at the end of the meeting, the advice around like take one, specialize. It's well placed, but if you actually survey the market. You realize you're also swimming in a lot of different startups that are trying to do something of this. And then it's about, so use case is one game, but I think it's also about like. landing that one or two major clients, right? So it's very easy to build a utility that a three person startup will start using, right? Or maybe for recruitment and so on. but their ability to pay is limited. So they'll use it while it's free and then they'll move on. If you can get like two, three significant enterprise clients, 200 employees or more. and then do whatever it is we need from them but it comes with like a $50,000 check per company we sell it to. That to me, positions us, I mean, I'm open to be challenged here, right? My thinking so far and I might be very wrong, right? Is that that actually positions us? AI tool. I mean it can be. And that could get me some back, but it's getting lost in its own and then that's just going to take us on a completely different journey. So one thing I didn't want to do right was just beat the startup into something to fit like antlers rubric if that makes sense 30 users right and they're paying me like whatever 20 dollars a month I mean, I don't I would rather a major company gives me like a hundred thousand dollar check than Antler Give me a $200,000 check for like a thing that I wasn't trying to build in the first place and now I have 30 users to support on a product offering that is not necessarily even pulling us in the right direction, if that makes sense. Maybe that's a necessary step to take. So that would be very valid feedback. Maybe. One is we, for example, it's an app to be a fair amount of sales and like kind of case sort of somewhere it's pretty much where we start in fact I remember Rohit once said no to This is why when I was at Synaptic when he had I was two friends and he once said no to 100 I think Capital G at the time wanted to buy it for like a hundred and five and for some reason he was like really adamant saying 120 is as low as I'll go and I'm gonna stick to it no matter what and he just let a really good customer go out of stupidity and he still regrets it. It's a huge chicken and egg problem again, right? You need a lot of customers for them to be able to trust you because 100k is kind of a lot for a lot of people. Many of these guys have these premium products where they try some kind of land and expand. Airtable does that really well. where they'll say, you know, there's X number of your employees using Airtable for, you know. Either the few free plan or like $30 a month. There's 20 people in your for-firm using it that $600 How about I say you a thousand dollar enterprise plan and start and push that to I don't know and a thousand dollars or something We go on them as that. So these two things we do, right? When you're sort of trying to be very startup-y. So we've pretty much broken it down into three buckets. Yes, we have it. A lot of them, nobody wants to be that guy who gives you money and then you build a product with his money. I would much rather have it, you know. something is already built and then... Totally I mean I can feel the same way about like investors to right They're like, oh, come to us when you have five. I'm like why would I come to you when I have five customers? I have five customers like I don't need money that Yeah, I know exactly what you mean, but then I tried these days I tried to kind of see a bit of their point as well, which is that this probably wondering I don't think it's a big risk for them because... Sorry for getting you shot here, but one But one of the things we've learned a lot working with VCs and their data and like looking through that is none of this is a risk for them. They are in the business, like, you know, they make like a single fund will make 15 investments, 40 of them will go to share. Interesting so they're they're they're just interested in like those two or three companies that's a sort of in some sense the right trick is not to convince them that this won't fail the right trick is to convince them that look there's 90% chances will fail But the off chance that we succeed will actually make it really big and you know will be the guy that returns your 20% to 30%. So then your 20x or 30x. So they're not interested in knowing that you're not going to, that you're going to succeed. their interest in knowing if you succeed, how good could it be? Yeah, it probably get a lot these so I don't I don't personally think that it's a lot of risk for them like they're not putting money I understand I understand I mean so I've looked at the market sizing through a few different approaches. One is like, percentage of time of like project managers and then people in non project management roles doing this kind of work In that world I see like a about like a 300 billion dollar opportunity here give or take And if you break that down, and I tried like two, three different methods, right? So. US Department of State like are spent in meetings like making z reports on like are spent on business admin that kind of stuff So I triangulated this figure. through a few different approaches, right? And I think about 20 to 40 billion of that is just like project. Like your software engineering project management kind of market the market is huge, right? This is going to be in fact I have evidence of there being like people coming on the court deals with this like to me even Gong I mean Gong is more like revenue ops marketing outbound sort of focus, right? But their success story is a data point. And now I know there are customer support. tools. So there's one called like I interviewed with the company recently like two weeks ago. All right, so that's that's taking off. I think like project management high context project management management is still ripe for the taking. So what they're going to do is they're going to deploy their own teams to like that's what I was doing at Google as well, right? Like I was building these automations which are Google specific, but internally. Like five years from now, we're something like a ZIP year. a ridiculous amount of their revenue from just like a handful of like enterprise clients. So they've got like 40% of Fortune 500. and that's making them like I think it's like I don't remember the exact stats but like north of like 80% of their revenue the B2C arm is just for brand rather than like oh I have like 50,000 people using this as their note taker I mean who cares that's not that's not a billion dollar idea not not I mean, five years ago, it could have been, but not today. That's just not what the... And I'm sure you know, right? You've been toying with LLMs and then obviously... You're quite plugged into what VCs care about as well. So you probably Second, that opinion? No, A lot of I mean the real money is basically in all these guys getting I mean getting like those 10 plus million dollar enterprise deals snowflake actually has 100 plus I I remember when Instacart put out their S1 One there was something like 120 or so odd million dollar bill on just snowflake. somebody goes out there and gets like make just sells it for a hundred million dollars to instacat that's probably how it that's probably not how it works You usually set it for 500k and then just like the data explodes. I mean you just built them from the server right? Like here's what we're paying to keep your servers up. No, it's basically the beauty of usage-based pricing is that Supporting staff, But yeah, I mean, it's great. It's super exciting. And what he'd do typically is... You almost always ask for is like when you say something is like, well, did your users tell you that? Do you have users? That's something that they're really, really obsessed about. They don't have to be paying customers, but you have users because what they used to tell us, they used to keep pushing us towards this, which was that The biggest mistake you're going to make is And we made this mistake plenty, right? So they should tell us that the mistake you guys are going to make is that you're going to have this vision in your head. So, you can. I agree. So, short answer, right? They can't help but because these are not enterprise users. So they are not using the product. They're not even the right users, right? Like they're not, which is, yeah, it sucks because when I say it like that, it sounds like, oh, you're still in your head, right? Like you're looking up. I haven't answered the question why, but not the resources to. build it yet. So they want to write the enough for you to make a credit card purchase which is likely to be approved by and then they creep on it, right basically Yeah, so the idea basically is you get your foot in the door. I mean, again, classic slant expand for SAS. But the idea is that I'll show you something. This is the pricing page I put together. are to flame iron places many are security meteors transcription Yeah, but the thing is I can't scale that. Like I took it so I mean, this is not a competitive product against like order. I have like users on this, right? I'm not billing them. But yeah, it's not and also like there's a like the decision to build them or not is also like a two-sided kind of thing, right? also that right like once you say that. any serious professional, right? So I mean like... Yeah. No, I don't. I don't. Just to be clear, no matter, I mean, you know, Whenever it is that I get back in into the game again as I put it in my head What I'm trying to avoid for myself is trying to be the idea guy, which is, hey, I have an idea, now you go build it. Nobody likes those guys. know What do you think would be? would they be right like would you want to be focus on like trying to bring in an investor check. trying to go to market or like take the product to market. Yeah, operations Yeah, the parts that I have. talking to them and sort of like understanding their language. But I think Pitching to Messas is really Because you run a process you do it for like hopefully just a couple of months or three months and then we get back to building and doing your own thing. Yeah That's sort of like that's the that's a side show it's necessary but that's not you know you don't you don't really do that. I would be very wary of someone who said their full-time job was pitching to investors. Yeah, so So basically a lot around the sales, the operations as well as Look, I'm not really, I don't think of myself really as somebody who's an expert on product. from a customer perspective, which is I'm like, why are you doing all of this? He asked for this, just give him this and this would work. So let me ask you a couple of tactical questions. How do you feel about like, it's ironic, but like the actual like. project management work. So even in engineering there are like a few aspects. You know the choice like some of the strategic work you do around it and so on a bit of design. Let's park that for a second. I can tell you in a very crystal clear manner, it's $1.30 per hour. and that's a break-even price for us. That's a composite price, right? That's a net sum of like... It's not a trivial computation, right? Like there is a design architecture element that's kind of gone into it and it's deliberate. I mean, obviously, there's some costs that I can't actually we can kill that cost. So like if you see it, it goes down as we scale up. Right, so it goes down to like a dollar an hour at the enterprise level. Where Initially, I was just hacking around, right? then they don't let you access it. And even if they claim to have APIs, they're going to take you on such a ride, you'll never see the end of it. that I would basically fire up a virtual machine, right? And then. have a screen record and have a, so there are browser automation testing solutions like Selenium, right? It's like a button B, you can do that. And there are many, many solutions for it. Selenium is like one of the industry leading solutions, right? So then I used Selenium in my VM. So I've got some Python code that fires up a VM. Then as a robot goes into the VM. signs into a Google account, joins the particular meeting. from the meeting as it's happening. OpenAI came out with a library called Whisper. So then you just screen the site. I mean, Whisper works in a. synchronous manner, right? It's like. library that helped with it, like some guy had experimented with it. But essentially they make this for asynchronous, right? So like you can give whisper a stream of incoming audio Right and you you can basically make it asynchronous like real time right so instead of saying oh, here's a file Please transcribe you can say oh, here's a socket, please you can assume the data coming in from the socket. and keep transcribing it on the fly. So the way you achieve. just chunk it up into like 2-2 second files in memory and then the hacky, right? Like the robots file, like getting it to. get through the I'm not a human kind of thing making sure it doesn't get captured Like it's not it's not very expensive. The most expensive component of this is the cloud like The VM I was running locally, but if you do it on cloud, you pay for the cloud VM. So the hours of a cloud VM is essentially your primary cost. You dockerize it and... and then build it that way. So yeah, I actually have working code from that. So once you get the transcribed data from whisper, you then So I'll kind of like jump ahead, right? So at some point in the call, like I mentioned, working with a vendor. who does multiple meeting bot solutions for us, which is also an XYC company. So I was actually, so I was able to solve this for Google meets and then I was like, holy fuck, I'm going to need to do this for zoom and Lexus core and all of that. So I was like trying to see what I can do for Zoom. And I was lurking around on the Zoom developer forums. And I posted a query like how do I even like get like fire up a zoom meeting? programmatically and that kind of thing and the CE And the funny thing is I was like, listen, I have already sent you three emails. In the last one month, asking if I can, but you might be too big for us, right? Because you haven't replied. Now this is happening on a public forum, so then in order to save face She, her team came back to me in like 40 minutes after that post. Like they've emailed me and then. You know, they started messaging me and I was like fine great like only once you get like publicly humiliated then you're like, sorry Oh, please, you know, sign up our form and then you don't respond. Anyway. So that's actually a chunk of the cost of that 750 and they provide APIs where their tech stack is doing exactly this, right? What I described to you. the VM going into a meeting providing audio video feeds. That is what makes it expensive because if you like I'm pretty sure if not now then in a Few months you're gonna get an API where Google meets is gonna say like here's the transcript Like I'll come back to the, what was that thing, right? DTO assignment. The thing to focus on is not the price can come down because There are all these optimizations we can make. So their own pricing right now is like, I think it's like a dollar. 10 an hour and then at this point their price will be like 60 or 70 cents an hour and then the rest is my server cost, right? But if I come back here, that's not the part of the product that I want to focus on. The part of the product that we really need to focus on is actually this stuff. This is what will distinguish us. Like if we become like the best in the world at just these very specific machine learning tasks, right? With a lot of rich data coming in. And we're actually very well positioned. for high context business data coming in like not just Are you doing that with agents or are you just dumping the whole thing and then asking LLM to take a guess? I'm doing it in real time. So like I am doing it every like 15 seconds of the call. Oh, okay. Yeah. If I'm if if we've been talking for like, what is it now like maybe over an hour, right? If I Every 15 seconds now send the entire transcript. of the call to an OpenAI backend, then you can see I'm getting killed on tokens because it's growing. Just as you were starting you were talking about like, you know llama and so on so I've experimented with llama I've experimented with a few others building it in house, but like not going to say that. I'm going to particularly be cheap. I mean, It's all a lot of drama. You don't have to trust our vendors and you know, we're going to swap OpenAI for like Anthro because I'm Right? Like, But it's your data and it gives them a lot of confidence because their data doesn't leave the server. When you are training it and updating it, you are only moving like a... Right, so model weights are like data agnostic. I mean, they So, yeah, like the focus is on this. So I'm not. Looking too much into, can we bring this cost down? I mean, it's doable. So this is just what we get from the provider, right? So we write that. We can also productionize our own sort of stack. around actually doing the meeting bots. And by the way, I think the landscape is going to change. fairly soon as well. So I'm a member of like the Google Meets Beta program. So they are building these Google Meet APIs and so on. So that's not the bottleneck in terms of product development. It is the part that I highlighted. But then the provider itself gives you like 30 cents an hour transcriptions from. one of the industry leading transcription services. So it's like, it's a business like. Why get into it with a simple API change with a simple parameter change? I can just change it to another provider. I just literally need to change one small. parameter and then I'm using another provider on a different billing service. So The world of transcription services is a hot crowded one and and whisper actually killed them. I was very happy to see Whisperers. I was like, this is one less problem for me. out. My sense is that this is only so good you get a transcription because very soon you get... So one thing I would say is that We have an advantage in terms of like, yes, transcriptions will get to a certain level of accuracy. Firstly, the benchmark of humans doing it is also not perfect, right? A lot gets lost in translation and so on and in AI here you can do like multilingual so you can actually allow a person speaking Japanese and on a shared interface. So that's pretty awesome. But I mean, moving past that. This is not a cold transcription. This is not like, I mean... Okay, when we call the API in real time, the data we get back is obviously off context, right? Something like that. So there is like, we have the... land transcriptions even better than the base step. So like let the. providers bring the base English model or the base like audio to text. models to as good an industry standard as they can and then we can add a layer on top of it saying like. Building it is going to be a But the raw material is there. Like this is given given the right resources. These are achievable things This is not impossible to do. Yeah, and and coming back to so you're talking more like strands and happy place right so I like I mean your friend, your CTO friend might not like me but like you've seen my resume profile I am definitely both a PM and an engineer. I'm a technical product manager, right? I clear engineering interviews as well as I... clear like product manager and interviews. So that's my zone. What I have less energy for now is just like, so. You know when you're building something that is architecture work, right? There's the architect And then there's bricklaying work, right? I can't build mansions anymore. I'm so fried from doing that. And then the funny thing is like managing a team of like 10-15 engineers is its own piece of work, right? If I liked it, then I wouldn't be building this product to start with. look like. And then even on the product side, I have a lot of ideas. So if I show you my how it's going to be adapted to the specific needs of a client. The reality of it is there's going to be a client specific deployment of it. So ideas are not going to be an issue. who are resource scientists at CMU. Yeah, whatever. So the startup he wants to work on is he wants to literally send a He wants to provision some space on SpaceX's next satellite. Yeah, so, so post NASA like even ISA actually they have a very similar product. So it's like a Finnish company. and they do like satellite imagery and they advise governments Now they're doing really well now because they are there because of the war in Ukraine So they get like so many inbound requests. So, you know, like when the world is going to shit like global warming flooding wars right their business prosper Anyway, so this guy knows his way around tech systems. We can read architecture with him, and he's also well-connected. And then I have... friends at DeepMind as well. a lot of Google's core AI. DeepMind, the... So yeah, I think that is a that is There's a good sort of start in terms of product and technical direction. essentially like marketing oriented, right? Like land in advance check. essentially right whether it's an investor whether it's a customer or a bit of both or something in between, right? Maybe our first customers take some equity. whatever that structure might be. So actually, when I told you I'm talking to the managing director of Micromax, they love it. What we haven't worked out is like what that's going to look like. So what they're trying to do now is they're trying to Basically bring the product across to their existing clients. So in India there is a company called HFCRS for example. So I'm talking to then it gives like Micro Max a lot of confidence in terms of. Like, okay, this is a marketable product. So like, let's invest. But yeah, I mean, like, I have a similar philosophy as you, right? I wouldn't start off in this direction, this is achievable. It's very achievable, right? It's not a question of if, it's just a question of who and how. Building the MVP is not the hard part, but now nobody uses MVP anymore. So then we move from MVP to MMB, minimum marketable product. Okay, and now with AI, all the rage is like... the minimum, I think it's called MQP or something which is like some form of like minimum product that has a certain degree of acceptable quality. And so what is the investment to and. I'm not selling the idea anymore. I'm actually discussing the two challenges of the tech business here. What is the return on investment curve in terms of the quality for the dollar invested in? So, I mean, if you look at AI companies, right, getting... to at GPT level intelligence is now solved. but then taking it from that point onwards to something that is almost human-like. that is an order of magnitude more kind of like investment All right, we don't have to go all that far, right? We're not trying to solve general purpose intelligence. We just want a very. These are solvable problems. These are not impossible to solve. But and that's why the pitch deck actually asked for two million and not like 100k. I'm almost not interested in 100k. I have enough resources to take that cash. So that's kind of where I'm at. Okay. So your challenge in some sense, basically right now is just getting that. Either the same check or just the, basically it's a money thing. It's a resources thing, right? It's a resources thing. And look, I've spoken to some investors now and I know I know how the story looks like on the other side of the table as well, right? I've had people pitch stuff to me and everything. Like they can smell desperation from like a mile afar, right? They might not know jack shit about product or tech or even market trends. So they're working off these sort of like weird signals. Yeah. So like, if you need, so if I, if I wanted cash, like. six months from now, I don't think there's a problem, right? You're smiling because you know exactly you've been there. Ask for money get advice ask for advice get money Maybe that's what I should do actually. I should just go to investors and say like, what do you think I should do? Yeah, I'm not looking for money. I think you know, but maybe you can advise me on the product here and Anyway, anyways, that's the, that's the. I didn't realize I was not presenting but I mean I didn't present anything new Did I show you my feature list though? Did I bring it up? No, I didn't see OK, awesome, awesome. taken our first check yet. The playing field is open. Oh, yeah. to that conversation. I think that's kind of good to go. I mean, incorporating in the Gulf has its own advantages, right? Like the tax. Right, so it's a but it's one of those problems again like need money to to get money, right? You do cost like about, I think it's like. But yeah incorporated so entity in UK entity in India But for me that's, by the way, it just takes like a week, right? And there are like at least three or four different services that will do it for you. So it is not really a challenge. think about LC Co-op so they have like slightly different governance structures and like footprints in terms of like sorry footnotes in terms of you know how you go through different rounds of funding, how people get diluted and so on. But I know investors... That's the standard vehicle for investors in the US. Any reason you are not like based in London and not moving to the Bay Area? My fiance is a US-based Googler. She is an American Googler. We met in 2019 at Berkeley. So I was doing a course there. She was the only other Googler at the course. Yeah, so it's been like five years now. Immigration, right? Even a fiance visa takes like a year and a half to come through. it's in the works. It's in the works. So I've been in the UK the last like seven years. This place is comfortable. London is a pretty good place to be. Actually, more so if you're in finance. Finance salaries here make me wish I went to a higher education system. Pick that I am Bangalore course instead They make our eyes water. like this is a good place to have a finance career like New York, London from what I can make out The best guys in my batch in finance are either in the Justin four places New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. Yeah, yeah. You're talking like. 2X, 3X, like tech salaries, right? So Jason, my tech advisor is based in Menlo Park. But again, the investors were interested are also spreading Micromax. I mean if they invest, if they come in as an investor, they're based in Gurgaon. There are a couple of US companies as well. California would be a good place to at least At least have an office, right? So we can just. 20 minutes drive up to a VCU office and have a chat with them. That's hugely unlike the the the VC sentiment there is That's the right network to plug into to get like a sizable check for something of this nature, right? married into the idea you are the stage are you to sort of easily. The neck down, this is the idea you're working on or? The story I like here is, so I'm going to tell you the story, right? when he was about three or four, four batches, four years before us. Let me know if you know the story. They moved to Stanford to study. and realized that they didn't want to complete the master's program. They decided to drop out. They might, I think Max Lefchin or somebody pitched their VR idea and he was like, yeah, this is great. So what do you have with VR? And then they sit there and realize they have no shit about VR. But and like look nobody's we've already taken you in we like you so what do you want to do? Like can you do something else? And then the guy goes look we wanted to build So, valvins are going to go build that. Then they went to New York and did a bunch of meetings with a lot of And they say look yeah, we're not going to be able to replace Bloomberg. It's too hard, too entrenched. I don't even know where to start. And they do this for another week or two, and finally they're out of ideas of the link. Yeah, that was cool. We're dropping out of the batch. We don't have an idea. Keep your money. And then at that time he had an idea which was And he basically says why don't you guys build a corporate card for startups and they're like, well who's gonna buy it? And then he just, you know, they've got a bunch of companies right there in the group and they're like, he just points at them and like, how many of you would take this service if you had it? And they all raised their hands up saying it's impossible to get a card if you're a startup. And then they started a company which does this, which is Nowbrex. and photo is just a way of proving that you were that place. I mean, I also really like the Slack story, by the way. So it didn't start as a enterprise messaging app at all. So, The thing is, given that I'm nearing the end of my runway, I'm... I'm open to ideas. I mean in any case the customer pitch that I have right now is like, look, whatever APIs you have in your company. Right? So yeah, I mean, like if you if you want to do if you want to make sure none of your PMs are out of the world of tech. any tech you get like a within five seconds notification from your phone saying like this guy's fucked up or something That's what you want, then that's what you'll get. The other idea I did have was I was also keen to It happened every day in the world. And yeah, I mean like. the amount of... Okay, I'll give you another example of a customer. So my good friend of mine is a Supreme Court Lawyer in Delhi. Right, so it's like discussing the idea with him and then he was like, holy fuck dude like Do you want to do an e-notarization business with me? So he had this insight that the government of India is going to start allowing for e-notarization, right? So like you and I are already meeting and this is on the record. And what if the bot sends us a docusign link? which has the stamp and everything and we just sign it while in the meeting and now there's an entire digital record of it. So you don't actually completely removes the need for like a physical meet. And you mentioned Bloomberg and finance came up a few times. So I mean, I know the challenges of like doing transactions in India. It's a legal mess, right? The right ease of doing business is just like non-existent. That's why I don't actually use my Delhi company because I have to go through like Programmatic trading, even just like actually closing trading is like huge, right? HOTA vs COLD sentiment analysis on a tweet is like unprecedented, right? Now, what if, actually it's not far removed from what you're already doing, right? What if we could... consume that data and I mean one thing is to give it to VCs another thing is we can essentially combine that with sort of other market. automated or algorithmic like trading or investment vehicle deployment. The quality of signal out there. You mentioned people talk about these things in phone calls. Right. So, okay. I'm not I don't have a phone call solution yet. But guess what? I do have I have a Google meets call solution So anything that's been discussed on a Google Meets call, if it's something that you do want in a structured manner. doing the regulatory work around the transaction we can sell the signal. Right? It's like, here's the signal, here's the data, you do the trading. hypothetically, right? And now we can actually understand what it's talking about rather than just looking for like dumb keywords. barring obviously hallucinations and so on but it's still an untapped signal And I recently read, I think it was like three days back there was an article saying like trading solutions are running circles around like their human counterparts and I mean, surprise, surprise, right? It's a knowledge-driven. industry, business, and how much knowledge. can a human physically hold or grapple? AI will always beat humans on those kind of things. So the trouble with that industry though, we saw something in a related industry but not the same thing, right? to kind of be fault and I know what the right way to figure out who the right people are. How come you're not the guy doing the landing? Yeah, yeah, so I'll give you, I mean there's, This was my second idea of choice. I was not actually kidding around. I actually ran an experiment So I built a reinforcement learning agent. that was playing the stock market. And the thing is like, I would simulate it with a fake budget of like $10,000. And it's like just make buy sell decisions on this like array of like 50 stocks, right? and do it like x times a day some guardrails whatever So, 9 out of 10 times, it will just burn my $10,000 in transaction fees down to zero. Right and then every one out of those ten times and like this was repeated So I didn't just run it ten times like I ran it like let's say 200 times, right? And so I just saw that in different batches, this was a recurring kind of occurrence. one out of every 10 times, it would actually have like runaway returns. What is the upper limit on how much money it can be? There is none. How many it's a bit like it is gambling, right? It's gambling with AI thrown in. How many? How many 10k's can you throw in the bin? Before you get to... That's the question they're going to ask you as well, right? Because if you're saying, I mean, That's really the question they're going to ask me. What's the expected value of all of your trades, which is that? there is potential here but it is way too risky. It's like seven million one second and then you like check it after like four seconds. It's like And then what it does is it just like extends the time trajectory on which it. essentially shows a similar behavior. It's not super reliable. And so what I took away from it was like. This is a good experiment to run when I have like a few million Sitting around, right? It's like a good, it's a good second, third startup idea. It's like. the SpaceX for like you know SpaceX for Elon after these exited payback. So that's. That's my kind of net take away from it. The potential is massive. Is it safe? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. It's not reliable, it's not safe and it's also not a I don't have this infrastructure set up. I don't in some cases, they don't have a banking lending license, whatever you need, right? So there's a lot of paperwork and just a lot of license, Raj. Shit happening there. That's one second thing is that like this is profitable at a certain scale Like, that's why I'm saying, if you have a 100k, you have a potential to make a few millions. If you have 30k, please stay the hell away from from a solution like this, right? Which I respect or maybe I don't inspire that confidence in you. Obviously, that's shooting yourself in the foot for that call, but that's the arch reality of it. Most of them would want that kind of thing to be internal and not external. So all of them did that. So we find this in synaptic as well. They say... We'll pay you to build this if you don't sell it to any of our competitors At this point you are like why you are not paying me enough to not collect. dollars. I mean, here's a good idea, right? Give me a share of the... share of the revenue in perpetuity and I mean, at least that gets us our exits, right? Our respective exits. And then, you know, how, firstly, how enforceable are non-competes, right? And second, They can't stop you from doing something for the rest of your life. I don't think there is I mean I might be wrong, but that sounds weird to me Just because you put something on a contract and got two people to sign it doesn't mean it's like If we have a stake in the performance, that's a great life. So a lot of folks from ID typically you find. The one thing that they all say constantly is that... You don't have an edge for longer than a few weeks, which is that no matter how good your algorithm is It basically runs its course in a few weeks because somebody figures out that you're doing this. Their job, one of them actually like ended, one of them actually quit and when I asked him why he quit, he likened it to being an athlete. experiments in your garage and like seeing a certain return, right? And you're like, wow. So. Sure, that could well be the reality of the job. You only know if you actually play in the market. The idea that like the theoretical potential is there is hmm I would I would also ask one more question though, which is quite interesting. So you think about it in terms of like an arbitrage opportunity. There are levels of operation where you're not even a blip on the radar. And and and there are not one but like Quite a few redimends. Just nicely enclosed in there. I'm not doing anything else, but... That's...that's... That's very...don't get too greedy. I would imagine in an HFT role that's really hard, right? Because once you see... It's more like a make out. It's like. The funny thing is I discovered very recently that all the HFT operations in India, a lot of them are based out of the same building. Really? Wow. I don't know. I think it's just like some kind of path dependency and not a product of... anything else, but all of them are based out of. I forget what building it was called, it was called Bindamari types. It's not the comoran restaurant. I don't know if you've been there. Comoran is like a really popular restaurant in Gurgaon. And let me actually look that up. So this is one building. A lot of those guys are in... Interesting. I'm not sure why that is. some reasonable degree of insight, which was like, It's a good question, right? It's a... How married are you to the idea? Honestly, I had the I had that you know that painful like My baby is that kind of feeling when I saw spinach I even though they're not strictly doing the same thing. But I, I mean, the role of a VC whether we like it or not and especially when you talk about like You know your Sequoia capitals and your YC and the likes, right? They pick the winning horses, right? Idea could be the same, another team could be equally well positioned to do it. These are the chosen ones. And so it's still a viable business. Even if you have a small team, 50 people, you get to like... half a billion, one billion or even like 100-200 million In regarding that I mean that's a very successful company right in my in my book it's not like we have to be like Slack or like get to like the 10 billion kind of market. I mean, that's that's okay 300 million is such a huge number. I highly doubt it's going to be one company that's going to capture the entire market. Is this not going to be true? And then you also become like an acquisition candidate for these companies in the future. Apparently not. People are keen to talk about it. They want to see it as a I mean there's one US company, I mentioned digital align on the deck. And they said we want to kind of bring this into the offering. same issue. Sorry, what company was this OK. Yeah. So but yeah, same issue, right? Can I use the product like tomorrow? I'm like, no, I need I need money. I need to polish the product I mean, you can use it. I shared the details with them, but obviously it's not the product. It says. on the 10 yet. Yeah. So what motivates that question? Like are you do you have ideas? I mean, could you have a Is that it's usually a bad idea to be married to the idea before you find product market fit, right? And my best definition of product market fit was again when we were in YC, Rahul Gora who started Superhuman. And somebody would ask them like how do you define what product market fit is? And their definition was that it's like finding product market for it is like being in love You know, you never have to ask yourself a question. How do you know you have product market fit? It's like if you're asking me that question, you don't have it. If you're pre revenue by definition you don't have product market fit. Okay, okay. So that's, I mean, that's a bar that we don't hold up to. My conviction is that like, like, If this product is built, getting customers through the door is like the least of. least of the worries, right? Like it's just, You've been in the industry for a few years, right? Think about any like reasonably large enterprise, right? or want something like this or if you ever spoken to a project manager But I mean, obviously initially when you sell to them, you're like, oh, this is going to make your life easy. Which is which is a whole different how The market is there the product is not there yet. So the product needs to cut up to the market The idea that I have been sincere to ask, the idea that I had been thinking about for a while, and this is obviously not something that I'm like... fleshed out to the point of I mean you I wouldn't even know the product is here A lot of so I had to interview like a shit ton of people And one of the things that I noticed is that lot of the financial operations that sort of financial firm financial Financial institutions make up something like 25% of the US and the developed world's GDP, right? Something anywhere between the fifth and the fourth. and a lot of their operations actually do not happen on site. Increasingly less and less so. Front And quite a few of them are pretty smart guys. And then one of the questions I have for them always is, keep reading up more and more and talking to more and more people on that. Let me flip it around. Whatsoever, financial or otherwise. Product operations. this operation. Like, I mean, what does operations even mean to you? Like, I guess To me, there's a undercurrent of like there's a process here, right? There is some structure of like input output checkpoints, right? Some some I mean that's by definition codified, right? It's... like it's like processes, it's already described to them, the work is described to them in a codified manner. It's just that. There are certain things that machines can't do. machines is actually shrinking. And so a lot of the like even like even meetings, I think I mean like there are a few things that I think are still but we trust humans to do it or we need someone to blame. still feel a human connection with. I mean that's still true as of this generation. But I've looked at some of the research that... Google and Meta build their products off of. And honestly, the But yeah, I mean like this creative work that is high context human work. I mean, I've also been very intrigued with drones. The challenge is that... drones and self-driving cars. I have a couple of folks who are my friends in Waymo. And funnily enough, like, There's a reason why not every car in California is just a self-driving autonomous car today, right? I mean, in theory, why would you see that? And the reality of it is that actually getting the machine to reliably perform at the same level as a human. without specific issues and the moment you add like a little more complexity to the equation like city driving and those kind of things, then you can do it, but the computational costs and the machine costs of doing it does not justify it. Anymore. Like if your Waymo gets vandalized you're screwed. I mean one question I would ask just putting some product thinking here, right? Financial operations is very broad. What do you think is the highest cost, highest value? Like, oh, no, that's part of what I tried to figure out with these guys, but. I know that they move a lot of So investors move a lot of their back office stuff to India. quite frequently when you're trying to work on a bunch of deals. A lot of the deal diligence happens in India, going through the documents, understanding exactly... So I'll give you one example, right? A lot of private equity companies need to do... to M&A transactions and when they're looking at They require public comps in that particular industry. So let's assume that you have a private equity company working with an HVAC client and they'd like to buy them out. You want to know what the... the M&A landscape for the HVAC industry looks like. around the world for the last three months. And that is something that you don't necessarily get just from pitch book. You get a lot of data from pitch book. But you also frequently a lot of these guys just like Google around, find a bunch of articles from the usual suspects, put a lot of these things together, and then you have a human at the back end doing a lot of these things. And every time I talk to them and ask them to break down their work in my head, I'm like... This is a machine's job. Like the difference, I guess, from two years ago. The big difference in my head is LLMs because quite frequently A1 is passing through all of that. nonsense and trying to figure out exactly what we said and be then trying to put it back in a language that these investors understand and sort of breaking that down that you're going to have to I mean, I don't know, I have thought of it only at a very high level so the details might completely fail. In my head, like you have to think of it in terms of trying to build multiple agents for different kinds of things. Sure. There's a word I've I mean, it's a key phrase. It deludes me right now, but essentially it's talking about the process of stacking AI models, right? And so you have like a graph of the 3D model that are highly specialized and then you have an orchestrator. which are specialized, get result, which is what you want to do. mean, I should search and build this way. Like, it's not, yeah. So I was actually looking at a bunch of this. This is one thing called Clue AI that tries to do something like that. I was looking at... Those guys, Microsoft I think has something called AutoGen. Those are the two ones that I look back. But I mean, in my head at least, I'm like, you know, the engineering part can actually be figured out. You have to figure it out. You know, what are the highest value operations that these guys actually do? So on and so forth But yeah, I don't I don't I don't really have like deep answers that it's just it's a product of talking to a lot of these guys After having interviewed them and after having done one small corner of that myself. I can give you one insight that I think would be helpful, simply because I've had a bit of that exposure myself. I mean, they're very smart people, but they're not. But the designs that actually succeed and trickle out to the top in terms of model performance. are not engineered. What they do is they throw and then just let them compete, right? And so now you have like these 10 different models. And some of them don't even make like basic sense, right? But then So when you think about a reasonably sophisticated AI model, debugging it is nearly impossible. Like even the best researchers in the world couldn't tell you like what exactly is doing between those layers. It's a back-propagated learning. It's essentially a black box that's just seen in our data and it performs better than humans and it might. drawing the weirdest connection inside that don't make sense but the like Right. In fact, is that a isn't that a self-defeating like requirement from a system? if it finds out a better way of doing it. But that is incomprehensible to us. you figure it out, right? And then it updates its weights and the net logic of that. You can't even easily mathematically grab it. It's like complex matrix multiplication that no human can... I mean, you can do things around like model layer architecture design, right? But and then you're essentially after that in to it in that this is what it must be doing like giving it a long short term memory. Right, so it can remember things from like previous runs or have like a longer context window on a sentence you've thrown at it Now these architectural interventions that we make and then run essentially, you know, just a hundred terabytes of data. Go play. It's essentially working its way, in many cases, backwards. No one's saying like, I'll put a memory component like this and then this is what is going to do is not It's really not as deliberate as it might seem once the paper is published. These people are throwing machines and resources at the problem and So it's the same with like, you know, there's this like wild west of And I'm telling you, this is the reality at the highest level. It's very resource intensive. It's very resource intensive. It's experimentation. You might get lucky. Right, you might, it's actually like a mining process, right? You're just trying to build a clever library that does a bit of prompt engineering. So they would say, for example, if you put in Python, it will probably just, you know. make a class and then they'd say, okay, this is the role and this is something else and so on. And what's really happening at the back end is You just, you know, you have the fancy terms and all you're doing is when you actually send the prompt to the LLM, you say you are a and then insert role and so on. So it feels just like a bit of prompt engineering. So I think one thing I can share is, you know, the The world of NLP and a lot of classification, you can work with structured data sets. Function calling is that magical thing. I want you to give me the schema and then call an API with it. So when I worked on Google Maps, I was working with two operations teams. And this team in Gurgaon would look at their data sets, like train bus data. And then they would run 110 checks manually. like are the bus stops in the right place, right? Are there like duplicate bus stops? Are the... and hired like like tl3 the business school engineering students from across the country. Anyway, like that was the... the 15 person operations team in India, 12 to 15. And they were handling the long tail of Maps partnerships. So what do I mean by long tail? You get a request from like. a village or a county in Russia or rural Canada and they say we want a bus on the product. Right and so that request will go to that team in good now and then they'll run through Right, so part of my rule was to automate some of this right? So I did I came to good now I shadowed them Did exactly what you're describing right? Like what are you doing? Show me show me these like 110 steps And then I actually cut it down to six weeks because I just automated like I just wrote some tools and scripts and I reduced the number of checks they were running. I mean, I also killed a couple of parts of the process. So that was one. Then there was another team which is a bigger team actually is a hundred two hundred percent team Oh this train is broken right like the train is broken or like There's an accident on this line and these buses are not flying. Somebody will tweet about it And every time they found a tweet that required a rerouting on Google Maps, they will fill out literally a Google form, right? And on the outside of the Google form, you'll get a JSON, right? a structured JSON that will then get ingested into any endpoint on the product. and it will update routing for anyone searching for any directions along affected areas. So far so good. So the good thing that they did was they had last, I think, five or 10 years of data. of like this is the tweet I saw this was the handle I saw it on This is the action I took and this is the JSON. And the moment I saw it, I was like, yo, this is... This is perfect for automation because it happened at planet scale. So I wrote, so this is even before chart GPD, I wrote a, so there's this, So I wrote a Word2AC-like solution. And basically, it would read tweets and then And I had, I think 97% accuracy. And every time there was something that because these two had a lot of garbage as well, right? Like, oh, like. Our new mayor came and spoke to our transit department, whatever. So, you know all sorts of nonsense. So, polling was like kind of useless. I just turned it into a push model. So every time a Twitter handle will have something that is actually relevant to an update And like we were able to downsize that like 100 person team. I mean, like we didn't fire them. We just redeployed them, but. like we were able to actually downsize it by like five fold. Right? Because the work was gone, right? It was just gone. So this is very doable and like that's how I earned my promotions at Google, right? Like they expected us to solve problems like this. and he did it for the simple reason that he got I'm just like I'll just present it I think I might be And the whole point is like, make a, I don't know, make a solar system with. bullet points about each planet. Yeah, it's kind of populating it. But the idea is like, he got sick of this, I mean, it's very early stage. burnt out consultants were too, you know. too tired from moving individual pixels and also the one or two wait time. day, wait time it takes to send it to a team in Bangalore or I mean this is McKinsey US, right? And then they'll get the deck back and then they'll take it to a. Take it directly to a client after a 7 a.m flight. Like soaking in their coffee. I mean like so he did that for years. He's trying to do Obviously this product has a very significant like visual Now like American McKinsey partner, fun guy. But same like general principle, right? Which is like these existing Fortune 500 companies are We have examples from McKinsey. I think it's viable, right? Like this kind of spaces, right for destruction. I think that. thing to nail would be like if I couldn't pick. So in my case at Google, like I had a very specific thing. Like I knew that these 100 to 200 people have like this is their job, right? and the company is spending whatever this amount of money on them. And so it was the case, the business case made itself and obviously I was just plugged in. It was my job to improve this in a very direct manner. Yeah, I think it will be a question of like aggregating like which financial operation thing like how to So creating a, and you know, you don't even need to necessarily get the best one. But having like some kind of structure around like a stack rank like here are five types of jobs And I think this one has the, at least in a relative sense, the best opportunity or a reasonably good opportunity. Yeah, and I think we're onto something. In terms of actually doing the AI layer and all that for it, I'm happy to work it through. If you present sort of like, okay, here's specifically the. ACR like five data sources We actually get through some work. at work to speak to people who have actually done this before. Like you said, that's literally the part that. At least I'm trying to figure out which is what are the list of things that these guys actually do? And sort of like endo and if I were a human being I'd have to do whatever I do. And what is the volume? Like you said, not necessarily the exact. rank 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but approximately 30% of the work is such Thank you very much. It's like 9 here, that's totally fine for me but it's some ungodly hour in India man, it's like 2 or 3. I saw you running as well. Do you want to like rap? I will. I think 130 is probably like a good hand stop for me. But this was amazing. I didn't realize we'd spoken to this like. I haven't had a 3 hour call in a very long time. It was so enjoyable for me. I mean, I have so many conversations, but when you're talking to someone who just gets it and then you feel... And like, so you have such a high context match that you could actually have a fun conversation, So I definitely enjoyed myself. I love to keep chatting whilst being sort of mindful of time as well. Yeah, definitely would love to chat. You're based in... My family just retired. My dad just retired last year. And now that they've actually moved, like my dad's also like, okay, we might. I mean, there's nothing wrong. It's good spacious properties with like a small. If you are used to Moti Baag, then Baagka is going to feel a bit like... You know, one advantage I've seen at least with the uncle at The Moti bag is that you literally have everything like right there The security is amazing. I mean, COVID happens, you're the first person to get a hold of everything. not have every single human sense of your body offended. You have a lot in Delhi because Delhi has trees. Gurgaon has no trace. Yeah, but I'll tell you what Dwarka has that is not The Orca has open drains man. So the mosquitoes and the smells. from like the late 90s. No, I like you know, like all like use some non as good places in like Gaza bars or something like that, but Yeah, no, like it's it's but it's it's changing very quickly. So this is one thing that like And yeah, every time I come back, there's something new, something different happening. It's a lot of fun because you spend a lot of time outside doing exchange programs and in the exchange program you don't really have to attend classes. So you take up all the real basic courses. I mean, I remember our basic stat course I studied for the example. And one of the things that really struck me when I went there is just how fucking old everyone was. Because you get into a bus and you're not at the average age and then you come back to India and you're like everyone's young. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, dude, so like Most of Europe is like 45. That's the average. India is like 31. College 8 kind of place. You kind of see like a lot of white hair and bald people. And in India, that's not quite the case. So one thing that I've been lucky to be able to do with being in London and working at Google is I travel a lot. So I've traveled to Australia, Singapore. A lot of European countries and so on. One place that's eluded me is Japan. and Japan is supposed to be quite a destination. Definitely want to go to Japan at some point. But exactly the phenomenon you described, like I think. You know if you go to Japan we'll witness it at a whole different level, right? Like I don't know what the average is there might be it might even be higher than like 45 might be like 50 Oh, yeah, I was I I think I don't know if it was a Japan is like the worst in the world I think Both of them are below replacement level, both at like 1.5 or something and the both sort of in some weird way very xenophobic. What I mean by that is America or England for example would allow a lot of immigrants to come into the country. The South Koreans are very keen on racial purity to the extent where Masayoshi Sohn is actually He is Japanese, but he's of South Korean extract And within Japan, they still refer to him as a kaijin. And Gaijin is like a foreigner there. He's been there for two, three generations. He's still considered to be a bit of an outsider. So a combination of not allowing people from the outside, like sort of maintaining your racial purity plus 1.7 fertility rate is like. horrible horrible combination what those two countries is The government is trying to enforce mandatory dating. So you've got like a government sort of the government will make it. The government is making it mandatory to have kids. That's so... we've come such a long way from like... Who would have thought that like you remember the one child policy like now we'll have a completely different interpretation of one child policy. But growing up in India, you kind of feel like... going to come in. Like really hit them hard. So I mean like I did I did an MPA, right? So we did demographics, policy, young people supporting the burdens of an older generation. Right life expectancy all those like like common statistics that they need to monitor So when you say fertility rate, that is a nuance there. And in Japan, I mean, xenophobia is another... like element, they are certainly not helping them. But like the biggest reason is like the social culture doesn't actually allow for it anymore. Like their work-life balance is like non-existent. Right? So people are putting in like 17 hour work weeks, right? You just go home and die. Like nobody has time or energy to date. It's like some subsistence lifestyle there and so people genuinely do not believe that like So the culture there does not allow for people to even... and to be honest like... I've come out of, I mean, I've been, life has been good for the last few years, right? But like, I did my engineering, I tried to do well in my program. I mean, it was not IIT but like... I came out with a gold medal and all that but like in the early stages of my career, I was like, dude, and also you don't make a lot of money, right? Like how the fuck are we gonna ever have kids? Like what is this shit, right? Where is the time? Where is the money? Who's? And so, and like... My sense of what life in Japan looks like is like, you know, they People never graduate from that. That is just life. That is just adult life. All of it. Like something like an investment banking job of sorts, right? That everyone has. without the pain. Like every other language you just call it death. You just collapse on your desk. I mean I can entertain a dark sense of humour, right? come close to evoking a similar sentiment like off the dome like Like Kota comes to It's not exactly the same thing but which if you're in Hyderabad like it's famous throughout the guy takes in like 250 guys Every year and then at least 120 or 130 in my match we had like 150 people So my section had like 55 people and all but. Three people made it to an IIT that like an incredible strike rate Wow not as bad as you because you never have like the whole suicide thing That's good right and I think like the city you're in also has a lot to do with it right But I think what also helps really change in at least So basically kind of self select for the people who are willing to put in that kind of work. What happens in quota is that After a while, everybody sends their packets there, whether they're interested in that kind of run code. And then here kind of self selects a little bit for that kind of thing. So my my so I mean I was like I used to come like like it was a full ride for all the foyers and raffles is like So they had like 50% of the school essentially was scholars We plucked out of like China, Vietnam, Thailand, like basically Southeast Asian countries. So in that particular year, there were seven And I think one went to water and one is like at McKinsey. He started Defog.ai. pretty eclectic bunch, right? Like pretty accomplished much. So what happened was like I went as like a hutta-kutta Punjabi kid. 14 year old right like 70 kgs as you would part is but our thousand all that and over there like Singapore as a citizen army, right? So by the time you get to like 10th grade you're basically doing like military drills like I had like the kids were ripped Like eight pack and they're doing like 50 pull ups and shit like that like all of them, right? an island off the coast of Singapore for like a one week survival camp in a tropical island right like I swam with snakes and shit like water snakes around. It was like you have to cannon. It was hardcore. Like for any Indian kid, like that was insane. So anyway, so I was academically doing well. I was I had maintained my perfect grades and everything and I was like, okay This is a you know, like an Oxbridge IV maker right like I took a flight came back to India for a week and my mom saw me at the airport. She just broke down She's like, where did my son go? Like they tortured my kid. Like, you know, like when somebody comes back from war and they post those pictures, right? Dude, so I kid you not, I kid you not, it's my third day enjoying my vacation in India, my one week break. And then she tells me that oh you don't need to go back. I'm like, what are you what are you saying? So she because I was a minor right like so she had agency my parents had agency on what so she She just called the school and said he's not coming back. She annulled my full ride scholarship at Raffles. And so writing essays and doing presentations around it. So A level education. At that point, I felt like a Harvard or like a Oxbridge. university admission had just been like ripped out of my hands right And then I was a very disillusioned and that's kind of when I think QWERTY hit me like full swing. So then I became like a complete rebel So autos there used to cost 200 bucks one way right and I figured out this beautiful hack That I basically found a guy that who's to drive whose driver used to take him right from next to my house I never told my parents that I had this jubbar And every like thrice a week I had this like cash injection of like 1500 bucks which For a 14 year old is like a lot of money So like So I would like go there bunk the classes and just enjoy life willy-nilly. So like the IIT train was not to happen for me, right? And then when I actually got into uni, so when I was exploring some options and then got into uni and then I was like That's true, that's true and yeah, I'm just glad I dodge that that bullet Uh, yes. immediate supervision because I'd basically gone full rebel mode man like When you're on track for something nice you're doing for your career and then... It's taken out of your hands for reasons outside of your control like and you know Your default thing is to blame your parents or something. So yeah, that's that. But I mean it was fun. I had good memories and experience and then I did learn how to play the guitar so that is that. And then there's a there's a mic here as well. So, you know got some hobbies and Otherwise I would have been a very very straight jacket like nerd so you know I have a lot I owe a lot of my, some of the interesting elements of my personality to that like weird face. Yeah, I get that like twice and give up I'm like this is not happening for me you I don't care about physics What was it? T block, N block, F S T, fuck. Dude kudos to you. So I was always good at math. Math was easy peasy, physics made sense to me. Chemistry. Gemma had no patience for man, zero. Let me not keep you. and sleep on the ideas and so on. anything smart to offer and then let you know. You're usually on WhatsApp, right? I'm on WhatsApp. Let me raise you a couple of words. We can keep exchanging notes. We can also do this like. Once a fortnight or something. I mean, you know, it doesn't need to be like three hours, but that's not a bad sign, right? And yes, obviously we hit it off I might plan something. I might come to Delhi in the coming months. still a bit unsure but every time I come to Delhi I'll like make sure I'll throw your shout. It would be great to catch up. few by any stretch or by at any time find yourself going to the bay Just give me a shout. We'll catch up. But I mean. But that's like physical meetup, right? Like WhatsApp and all is always there. Just like hack with or experiment with something Yeah, Yep, for sure. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Take care, Siddharth. Lovely job."
dbfe2a55-0a46-4536-8fbe-14fe4f5e6777,"Okay. Um, so team agenda for today is to review the applicant pool a bit. There is an assignment I have prepared. That itself is going to fulfill. I don't think we are interested in them. Sometimes too much experience can be a bad thing. If you start thinking you're above the work, then a startup is not for you. and shortlist emails. So that's basically a process. I'll try and close the decision before. April 15 or 10 if possible so that we still have a short of Some of these candidates are pretty strong. So it is possible that we might. be able to continue working with them outside of the YC timelines. And if that is the case, then In any case, we have add loads, but we might. thereafter be able to go to like very strong investors like Nexus or Sequoia or something like that. some of the potential candidates. So even if YC doesn't work out, it's not. not a biggie, right? So So that's a few things on the. applicant pool assignment and shortness of emails. on the feature list. I have a column called like dev points. Thanks. Interesting. Ah, that's what I thought. This is a slightly aggressive but the right number of days it should take like full time days, right? So it's like, only in this scenario that you work on nothing else and just this. like full time job. This is the number of days it would. we would typically allocate for some work of this nature. Strong entry level engineer. on a code base that is relatively clean. So if you're working in a big company, Your code base has a lot of baggage. So the estimates tend to be very different. but for a clean code base, like a fresh checkout. Not much code in it, right? Like not too many dependencies, single service, not like 15 sources. and so on. This is my estimation of like what is the. like both side of their points, right? So, Rishit, I... I think it would be nice to have a week for this call but we can take it up with a week as well. It would be good if you can also. add what you think would be a fair What do you think is a fair number of Okay, sorry for the delay. No worries. Good. So I'll stop sharing this. Let's come back here. Cool. What are your updates on the? I tried the Docker so the Docker version actually fixing those dependencies which caused the error while deploying it. Google Cloud is not going to have access to AWS. Yeah, I tried to find that AWS so I could not find it but yeah again I'll try. Yeah, it Also, it might be possible to just take the application code and deploy it without docker. So then that way it would be something like Basically like a NodeJS deployment, right? without the Docker itself. So because of that, somewhere the It was breaking somewhere. So I will try it. Sounds good. So we should try and wrap this up. try a proper deployment in the coming week because the basically the core product. I've mainly been working on the MVQ so far. Yeah. Yes, the previous one was this one, and he gave me some feedback, such as like a... like expanding a bit more on the different measurements to get maybe like perbs. statistics but I'll try to get the whole structure first. So first I'm trying to gather the statistics of a new scorecard I made where I get to spend the different features and then for each feature I'll have like a per meeting per hour. for day, for weekend, for user. and I plan to fill that up. So I'll book it down to you. calendar, tasks, features. It's the same way I broke it up last time as well. to be synced into the database, something like that. Yeah, integrations. how long it takes to set up the different integrations, the performance of the model, the performance of the bot. And yeah, so just trying to make it a bit more precise in terms of. how we can measure it because last time I think it was a bit too general. We're just these measures. See you again, we'll try to get up as fast as I can. Yeah, this is now looking like a better like matrix. dashboard overview. So once we have a clear expectation here. A, we can communicate it with our customers. B, We know what quality our LLM and AI stack needs to get. and what constitutes a successful versus not successful experiment launch. or client integration. So appreciate your work, this is great. I think. I think I'm quite happy with the overview of the structure. There will always be items we can add and remove. But I think an initial expression here would be. off the estimates based on some research would be good. There is also an activity that you can pull our opinions on. So, if you feel like we can come together with an opinion here. or something you feel like is a critical assumption. that we all should discuss because I don't know if you realize it but you are in the process of adding new metrics. Yep, yeah, yeah, got it, yeah. And that definitely making me think a lot more when I'm like... When you try to think of a metric to measure, you end up thinking how is the user actually going to use it. I think the structure is looking great. I think we just need some data, indicative data in here. The reality is once we actually start running real experiments, So don't worry too much about getting the... Sorry, what did you say again? I think you cut off at the end. The AI needs to be designed. think you think, yeah, you think we'll get hung up on the details and... initial expression of like numbers here, but Chances are when we do an experiment they will drastically change. But now that you've actually gone through this exercise, you'll have a much more nuanced understanding of like What is the goalpost that the architecture needs to live up to? And so you'll be able to bring that perspective into sort of architecture discussions going forward. And in fact, this is also something that you can in. They're like business and tech. It's very product. So it's a document that will make perfect sense to Prakriti as well if you share it with her. Right. and you'll have a good. you have Yeah, I do know. Just walk in. be able to access it using the link. like in the weekly meeting. Okay cool. do like few things, but do them really well. Right. And then. Once we close the task, then we can move on to the next. I think that's also. Unfortunately, Prakriti, you will not have that benefit. being closer to the business side of things. So typically, a role in business involves juggling many different things rather than. I also actually saw it on Avik's screen. the form. Did you share it with the. Yes, I did. There were some questions that I tagged if you can respond, which were a bit more technical. So that we could get those done before sharing it with you. I don't know if you've had time to look at the document yet. I've tried to answer a few things about sales strategy and stuff, but I wasn't too sure if like... So we'll probably need you to go through them. Also just a question. trying to appear a certain way for like investors or anything. And if that is the case, then can I also include the scoreboard somewhere in this? when I'm mentioning the KPIs. Yeah, so I think. So I've actually already let him know about the update with Rohit's involvement. and that we're looking for another CTR at this moment. So here's the view and it's the view that I built. By the way, he's already seen the app pool. So we can segue into that. is that the team is, it's very important to land the team. before going for significant funding because Typically, the serious investors at any stage So they invest in the team. So the team is the product. We got some clarity on Rohit's engagement. before doing a previous investor outreach. the only capybara is a dominator. He will not be able to leave his current job for another 4 months. and four or five months before joining such a right. So that even puts like something like even if we got into YC. it makes it very risky and personally I'm very flexible like I don't mind if you work in one job two job teaching at a university it doesn't matter right but the the thing I started to notice was that So it's okay if you have other projects that's perfectly fine but what we couldn't do a sort of like burn the like not have a not have a prototype. So I think because of the answer his his reason was obviously his job was very demanding him working in finance and so on So knowing that four to five months, like we will not get clarity on it for that. duration. It is not the right thing for us right now. It is entirely possible that like four months later, you know, once his visa is sorted, he is able to... Rejoin us. So good to remain connected and also keep tabs on them like how is Visa and everything is coming along. So in the meantime, we have, I think this is a good segue into, so yeah, so sorry, coming back, you have the CFO doc. I'll take a look at it, my number one priority right now. Other links that are put in the doc, visible to you all. But I found the LinkedIn of that guy anyways. If you can just confirm that it's the same guy, then. It's all good. Yeah, it's the same guy and actually he reached out to me problems like YCPoS. That's okay. YC is no guarantee for success, right? So like the thing is like okay, I see gives you 500,000 you can become illiquid or like find out that like I see makes a lot of mistakes 90% of those companies that get to do I see don't actually succeed. Like this is also not annoying. Yeah, so that's okay. They have like the founder of the company which he was in was Mantis. There's some other co-founder there. So I went to the webpage for that. Okay, that's a good question to check in with him. Actually, I want to talk about the candidates. to. But to go over it in a slightly structured manner. So like we can take that on. at least a couple of hours, and done kind of sensibly, right? I mean, probably You have to come through it. Yeah, yeah, I look at the document you shared as well, under one of CTO. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so the CTO assignment is... Rohit to basically answer after two months of working together. And unfortunately, that's something that I can see from him. not because he's not capable of doing that, it's more that So I, the new approach I'm following is. that I'm just turning it into an assignment, right? So all the candidates that we select. Their own assignment is their work. It is their own roadmap. I think a better way to structure it, what I'm hoping is we can get this output now. are not a good fit for us and we find out way later. With that said so regarding the wordings, so so there is another thing I've meant there's the shortlist email that I've sent as well So I'm kind of a great on it. So this is a standard process. I think it makes perfect sense for someone with like up to it at that point it's a toss up if they are kind of hands on and comfortable working in startups, then they will not be deterred by an assignment. like they should respond and but if they're very senior candidates then it is not the right way to approach them. They would be able to talk to them and they would want to learn a bit more about the company and roadmap. Maybe they want to see our pitch deck. which now needs to be updated. So one thing I need to do is on the... It would be good if we can create a Google group which you should be able to do now. Using the such a way ID and call it. Yeah, like something like applications are such, yeah. and we can correct inbound applications for the CTO position there. I think another good thing would be to take it with like. But then for all of these, I know there are certain risks like somebody's So I think it's good to kind of like raise it with. we will never hear from again. expectations. But it is they're taking 9% someone who is like completely aligned. even if their proficiency is like Part of the exercise is to also assess alignment. The assignment is something that should be enjoyable for them to work on otherwise they're going to hate working on the startup. So just wanted to come back and discuss it. candidate. So let me try to scream again. You have access to this. Yeah, OK, one sec. All have access to this talk, by the way. Yeah. I'll you you It is lagging a bit though so... If you want to switch off your camera for a bit, that would be fine, I think. All right, David, please. No problem. Also, I know such a video is has the. open up a certain panel or something. Such a system bot, right? Like, it's just an... meeting like any of the rest of us. Sharing can all choose to do like I'm sharing now. Is my screen visible? Yeah. I can't hear you if you're saying something. Whose voice my voice so? Adios. Adios. Okay. Bye. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Sorry team I I think my internet is like It's a bit unreliable so I might get pushed out again so bear with me. OK. Enjoy. I would hope that There are some issues that we can identify with them. So I noticed that We suggested we skip a bunch of candidates here. So a baseline expectation is like what is the justification to skip? Like, why should we eliminate them? So, I'm not, should, can we have a chat about that really quick? Yeah, sure. Yeah. So I think if I just select the. So what's the issue with Daniel? Just some context, Daniel is like he teaches courses at He basically teaches some online courses on Angular and Frontend. But here Yeah, I'll take it up with them, right? But I did speak with Daniel. Basically, he's a... You can only be. Then what's the issue with Michael? There was Yeah, so he submitted like a broken resume to me. Like if I show you the application, it's almost like a dope. But I don't think it is the resume. No. not really related to us. what we are doing. So that is true. So just to set some expectations here, right? Um This is a good thing to discuss. It's very helpful. So I don't get, don't get me wrong. But I noticed an interesting pattern. Um I just started this by AI experience. and then most of the exceptional and strong candidates are. our ideal technology is some more training, machine learning experience. like a mild bias because there are like two, three things that are really important. um... Like obviously, zero or very low AI. Experience or interest is a red flag. How do you say that? Having said that, we are also looking at a little bit of argumentability. Like what I don't want is that they've only done management for the last 15 years. enterprise software code right so then compliant code So I'm not too interested in the university. I am not too interested in poor researchers. who are just writing like research paper and No management experience is also a red flag. Which is like like AI experiences one. the strong exceptional and skip. need a balance with a little bit of mental ability. But not an entire career in management, right? We need balance with like. general will act to play the code and like code production, right? Like they should be. uh the voice is breaking Netflix. you We can't hear you. It's still pretty bad. I think. Nothing. See you, I guess. Connect later. yeah. I'm not going to be able to... I'm not going to be doing a lot of development over the next week and a bit. I have some course works that I do and also I'm flying to the US for a while because my term ended yesterday. I'm going for like a short trip. Not so short. Yeah, but like, I'm still planning to bring my laptop and I do some work. Interesting things, just to let me know, I could probably still take a call and we can discuss it. So yeah, I told Adi already. I think Adi might also be there. Where in USA are you? I think I need to go to California also. I'm going around like around all the national parks in like Utah and and Grand Canyon and Nevada and all that. So it's not so much in California. probably going to California then to Austin. Yeah, put an antler in. Yeah, they have already, so yeah, we'll try to get. Cool. Okay, bye. Bye."
5a9b192a-cd2f-433c-8ad0-ba50ccb6346a,"What I'll also do is I'll quickly bring up some of the... So this is Prasad, probably for your benefit a little bit. I'm just going to jump ahead into some of the architectural components. So there are other players in the market that do transcription. So I keep saying that transcription is not, we are not just a note taker. There's a dependency between them. We do this built on a RAC database of the company's employees, the documents. And we do this in sort of real time. And on the flip side, we're connected to sort of all these different APIs and tools. We're not actually competing with Jira. Our positioning is that... using this product will actually enhance and improve the usage of Zeta across your organization as well. So we don't see these tools as competitors. Let users love the tools they are already used to. From my program experience, I know tools tend to be very sticky. And it is going to be privacy sensitive. So in terms of the technology deployment, I mean, we'll offer a sort of SaaS service. So I'll jump back to the website, which might look something like this. and we'll basically configure it for you. But from my communication with a few medium scale and bigger companies, I'm aware that they prefer on-prem. And rightly so because it's a security sensitive space. flip through the pitch deck. So this is a bit about me. market is quite significant, right? So we see... through different teams and people using this in different ways. And I've also got that from my customer discovery calls. So when I showed it to for example a Supreme Court lawyer in Delhi He said, oh, this would be amazing for notarization. You just get on a DocuSign on a call with someone and you have a record of the notarization actually happening. like a video record of it, which is fantastic, right? And then, but there is the sort of program management market space and the niche I'm going after is actually that they tend to be early adopters. Number two, that's also sort of where my background is. And they also tend to be very open to sort of AI enabled and automation solutions. So this is a sort of, it's an easier. And thirdly, it's also a sizable market in and of itself. So once we have a bit of a moat there, Then that gives us good leverage to go into like I've seen interest from construction companies. government bodies that are very process oriented. So that's just a few ways in which I'm sort of playing the market. So huge problem, business admin. I've also added the link. to the deck, so you'll have it. You've already seen this visual. for the bot in the meeting, but I can present things. I can ask it questions about, hey, what's the status of that task? And then it can actually use the chat in the meeting. So currently integrated with Google Meets, but it's very easy for us to also support Zoom, Slack, MS Teams. and Cisco WebEx, which gives us a good cover on enterprise. by virtue of a technical partnership that I've struck with. XYC company that's just raised 10 million. So they provide like some of the underlying infrastructure on the meeting tech. And then our work is, our focus is to sort of add the AI, the program management intelligence layer on top of it. So this is a demo video which is also on our website. I won't go through it because we are experiencing the demo in real time. essentially an email like this, which allows you to. to download the recording of the meeting, but then also gives you some key insights. So this is already in production and. Companies that I met at Antler were using this for customer discovery calls. So if you had a customer discovery call, there are three or four things to avoid and three or four things to talk about. That's relatively an easy pick for LLM tech as it stands today. So does it actually tell me, just go back to the other slide. Yes. Does it actually tell me. Who is talking what? Yeah. Just a moment. Just a moment. A demo is worth a thousand decks, right? Let me see if I can just pull up my little chat window. So, this is another question when you say invite the bot into a call, what do you mean by invite the bot? But what is just a participant, right? configure like that image of a person from my server. So here is my tricky thing, right? Most of the meetings kind of go... I mean, very rarely we get at the exact level at least, very rarely you have a selected set of invitees. Non invited participant. Yeah. Oh, do you mean it like it is essentially not visible? to the other other because what happens is People become conscious when you put a camera on their face. People become conscious when you basically have somebody on your shoulders. and stuff. No, I'm not talking at a high level, right? As you go lower into the ladder, especially in an engineering conversation, some sales target conversation, you put a bot on their face. Oh, so like you mean that the areas where this is spectacularly useful instantaneously is universities interviews campus irings. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think the core stack is. So I'll have to, at a tech level, I'll have to look into, can it sort of not even appear as a, like a. attendee in the meeting. Think of Cisco Webex today. Bring the entire transcript in front of you, create a meeting nodes and set it up. So for the moment, right, Zoom meets are pretty restricted in the APIs they actually offer to their developer network. Right, so if you want to consume like real-time video or audio video from like a Zoom meeting or a Google Meets meeting, right? That's an API that you can't get access to easily at all. Like you have to be working with them and you have to get into a sort of business partnership with them that is usually undisclosed. The information around that is not in public domain. And so the So I actually discovered, so I was actually lurking on Zoom developer forums. As I was sort of building the initial tech, I played with the APIs. I'm actually a member of the Google Meets Beta API. which is an exclusive API where they're actually piloting the features that you can actually start. operating with the video. So that actually integrates a bit more seamlessly into the product. But for the tech that we have today, it does have to actually act as an agent. joining the meeting, right? As a sort of person. So literally somewhere in the world there is a virtual machine. where this meet call has been pulled up on a server or test automation framework. Right. And then someone has passed the bot has actually passed the robots check on the website logged in. Right. And then a video audio video screen grab is actually being ported to, you know, like my servers, right? So that is that is sort of how the tech is instrumented as of today. The other approach where it's just maybe a red dot on Google Meets. Now, it is entirely possible that Google will allow third-party developers to do that. but then every platform will have its own solution for it. Certainly, I can say that those kind of APIs are not. open to the general public as of today because I've explored them, right? So there'll be a there'll be a possibility to tweak the UI, but we're not there yet. But once you're beholden to a Google API, you will only get what they tell you. So it will be like, But I'll take a pause here, right? Like I don't know if I'm necessarily answering your question, but I do want to. I kind of understand where you're coming from, but just give you some clarity, right? I get the development forums, you get their post load of APIs available to you. This is all on the cloud. Can this be on prem? It can be on-prem, so we can definitely deploy it on on-prem. Yeah, I mean that's definitely can do it on-prem. The meeting. So we work with a SaaS company that actually gets plugged into the meeting, but we control where the, so they have a seven day retention policy. But after that, we control the data. So transcriptions, user accounts, the RAC database, everything. So I have my Google Cloud that's supporting this. But it's something we can definitely deploy on-prem. In fact, we recognize we need to deploy on-prem. Otherwise, it's not. for most medium large scale enterprises for security reasons. is the LLM having picked it up. It is costly to run it in production at every three second kind of call unless it's paid for. Right now, it's entirely linked. It's just linked to my credit card. So it's once every 30 seconds. Still gets the job done in terms of pseudo real time kind of inference. And then there is also a post-meeting summary, which is something like this. Now this is an email, but the idea is there'll be a dashboard where you can find all your past calls. Search them. based on project attendees, right? And then at the end of the meeting, you can also in a single click dispatch suggested action items and hopefully, you know, with minimal changes. So the AI is able to get most of the details right. And so with a couple of clicks, you can just, you know, dispatch it. So it saves you a lot of burden of going to six different tools and then, you know, emailing for people after the meeting. It just handles it. Now in the beginning, our inferences are going to fall in basically three buckets, low confidence, medium, high. or it can be hands-free or something. Yeah. Unless you basically hash it and you send it in. And that kind of keeps, you know, probably bigger discussions. It's just not a solved problem in computer science and distributed systems. Tools like WhatsApp and Telegram kind of claim to give you that, but they're also still kind of... It's more of like an ongoing journey where you will keep adding more and more security features and the. attackers are going to get more and more sophisticated. You don't need to go that complicated. So you can think IPsec. Just put it on an IPsec packet and send it out. It should just instantaneously solve that problem. It's not that complicated. Almost all aliens on the planet use IP. Yeah, so this is actually a great I won't say a segue, but something that kind of came up for us earlier. So, you know, in India, there's a company called Khata Book and there is an Indonesian equivalent of it called Buku Varung. which is also started by an IT tele alum who's also from Y Combinator. So I was talking to this guy and you know, this was sort of an early sales conversation we were having back in Jan and Feb. And they have 16 million clients across Southeast Asia of their own. So pretty sizable ticket for us. And they absolutely wanted this product. The issue we ran into at the sort of last minute was that they were ISO 27001 compliant. And had they integrated with us, they would have lost their compliance. And so I'm aware of SOC 2 ISO 27001 and a lot of the sort of security best practices are a part of it, right? Including like architectural review, process reviews and so on. The challenge I ran into was that these are expensive. So I got a quote from a couple of providers and it was like 30 to $40,000 to hand hold you through the process and so on. And it's also three to six months to... I essentially ran into teething issues. I wouldn't say I necessarily lapsed that client, but we're in this tricky space of, it's early stage, but going after sort of mid and large scale companies. Now, had we had the resources, then I would have been more than happy to kick off. And I recognize that we need a little bit of a re-architecture. before we deploy to medium-sized scale enterprises. But it's still not bad progress for a one-man effort. I have an intern team, right, which is basically folks from Imperial, IIT and so on that I coach, but they come and go. I've been working with trying to find tech co-founders. My issue is that I'm yet to find. So I do want to be pretty candid. It's basically a one-man effort. All the code you see in production today is just me. Right. And so I'm a bit out of like, runway as well. Right. So that's kind of a bit of the context around how I got to speaking with Rajesh. And then Rakiti helps me with a bit of sort of like the business, you know, drafting and some of the logistics there. But it's pretty small. And I'm the only one on it full time. you know, look, if this is CTO applicants, right, the problem is not getting incredible talent. The problem is being able to actually like pay them, right? And it's a catch 22 because investors want only 3% of Antlers investments and 1 to 2% of Y Combinators investments are in solo founders. I was actually in the top 10% of their applicants. So let's see if I can find that here. Y Combinator. Winter application. Winter. And they basically, yeah, so they said yours was in the top 10%. We strongly encourage you to reapply. This is not a standard rejection response from them. But finding a good co-founder is hard, and building a team is hard as well. Having gone on this journey solo, I've learned that the hard way. But this is, I think we've covered some of this. This actually talks a little bit about the like some of the stuff Can I can I can I jump in here? I just before you get into Why this, what you're proposing as a business, why, see you developed a good product, right? Why can't this product be going to an established player today rather than going to the market yourself? There are two ways of when you when you make a good product, right? You can I don't know Gira right Gira if Gira doesn't have this as part of their ecosystem go to Gira and say, you know Here guys, you're a big guy, do it. This seems to, you know what I'm saying, so that's one way. The other way is what you are saying that I want to make this product, I want to build it up and then I go to the market. a surprising amount of their revenue from just a handful of enterprise clients. They have 40% of Fortune 500 companies. using Slack, which actually generate like a majority of their revenue. Their B2C operations hardly makes them any... any money. So for me, the journey has also been very focused on B2B and actually talking to mid-large-scale sector companies. But access and trust is a problem. Compliance is a problem. And then initially, you know, I was thinking of it as a sales model and then I proposed like design partnerships as well. But at this point, I'm actually quite open to like The cost part is a bit more clear, what is required to actually grow and develop the business. Then on the architecture side, if we have a custom model deployed on-prem, what kind of outlay is that and how does that scale with? Again, this can be a bit flexible. There is a more B2C heavy model here. There can be one player, and they have a sizable investment here. And then in the discussions with some of these folks, I found that a lot of the value that they derive is the ability to plug into specific APIs in their company. So like for example, a lot of companies are building these chat boxes. So you have to go and type something and it automates. things for you downstream. So if that chat box is available on API, then we can trigger it from a meeting. for them and that custom integration has much more value for them than a generic product like you know Otter, Fireflies and a few others like note takers that are on the market. So, a couple of insights there, but I'm short answer to your question. No, very open to that. Very open to that now, I think. I won't say medium but let's say medium to large or a large client who may themselves say that why don't Where is my data? Because most of the meetings that you will be... recording, especially on the project management side, especially in engineering, especially in... Senior man. People don't trust, right? And I think that. So two business opportunities, one is as I said, somebody who is large enough and the other is look at an organization where you say I have built this, I can, you know, It's built, operate and then transfer to them saying it's yours. Because to do this at a B2C level, Aditya, I am... Still not very sure in the market. It is very, very competitive and big daddies are going to be in this faster than we think, right? And with AI. Prasad is probably a better guy to comment on this and I am sure there are many people who are doing this. So that remains my only big concern in terms of business model. I would still say look for a big guy. And this is a good product. You are you've done it well, then you need to you know, get a good market for it quickly. I don't think B2C is a I mean, when I look at the pricing page that early, that 29, it's breakeven, it's barely breakeven for me. It cost me more to actually. service that customer then then then it pays me back. So really the value is an enterprise plan. So I talk about slack. Slack doesn't really make money from B2C, but B2C helps its brand. So it's a product that is known to people thanks to its B2C operation. But the money is B2B. And I mean, that is also why these kind of conversations are. X thousand meetings happening in my organization. I can't be in all of them, but I wish I could get the highlights from all of them in real time. So we can certainly deploy the, you know, the. the bot across the organization and roll those up and every member of the organization every morning can get a quick email saying These are the three most important things for the day and then at the end of the meeting if you were in 12 calls, right? These are the highlights from the 12 calls. If you don't remember anything else, just keep these in mind because this is your summary for the day. And we can deploy this for an organization of 5,000 people. So actually, really, So Aditya, two things that I think Anil has kind of nailed it. Couple of two things that you need to be very careful about. clear when you have your conversations. One I believe this is a very good pitch that you need to do for PLM's. Program line managers, right? More than PMs. The PLMs are going to be easier to say. The CIO. are the guys who basically decide what kind of products are going to come in, the CIOs decide. So it's that bucket list. That's point number one. Point number two. ever get into this, okay, you deploy and then I'll increase licenses later on. It never works. Any CIO that you talk to, any VP that you talk to, first thing is So look, put it in for a few of my meetings. Let me play with it. I will come back to you. Let me see how you support it. Because in a lot of people like you would have already knocked his door. You would always remember. and then he will never buy a new tool just to accommodate you. His theory will be like, this is my infra, how you tell me where can you plug it in. There is a BLM story that you can say. I mean, as you were presenting it, I had done enough homework on you, your competition. And that is your single entry point checkbox into R&D. and if you talk, you talk in person. Yeah, I really appreciate that agreement. Either you encrypt or you bring it on-prem. works then what is it that you're going to take is it 10 licenses 100 licenses I have spent talk they love I mean they have been buying it's not that they have not been talking to sales right. This kid is good. I mean, it's awesome tech. I'll use it for six months. I fully appreciate that. I think the the so product roadmap as well. So we are on parity with the. This was, I should update it. I don't believe we are ahead of schedule anymore. But as of October, we didn't exist. And then this is all the stuff that we. have today but in terms of what actually constitutes a complete product, right? There are a few milestones. So I have action items from this meeting, right? And I'll share them with you after the meeting as well. But there is a lot of polish that goes into deploying an AI product in production and giving people confidence that is something they can rely on with their essential work throws and processes. And so a lot of that polish, that infrastructure stack is required still. brickling work of actually building all that infra out. And so for me, it's also a bit of a resources issue, right? pre-seed investment. So you can actually complete the story towards like the product. There is something you can play with today, but it is not the product it is promising to be or aspires to be. I do very carefully about that. Why do you take influence from Indian colleges? I mean not the IITs and the NIITs. They are very expensive. So you can really gain good interns in India. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I think, so I already have a few, I'm actually talking to a couple more. This week, but the reason I don't want to write off the bat scale the team to 10 or 15 interns, let's say and I don't do no internship season is nine. It's also about making sure that they are working with the right leadership. on ground. And so it's, it's, so I am, I haven't paused development, like I'm keeping, but The day I take on 10 or 15 interns, that is my full-time job and I don't have time for conversations like this or to go to market or pitch to VCs. So these are some of the challenges in being a solo founder for this part of the journey. But I agree with you. And I think there's some incredible talent in India. I mean, I myself am not like an IIT grad. I went to I went to triple ID, but no regrets. And, you know, I got so many benefits from that. So I agree with you. Fully agree. So gentlemen, I think because this is already 9 o'clock, we need to stop this call out here. But Aditya, I think honestly speaking, I really like your pitch and I see a lot of promising future for you. So maybe this call was more of an intro session wherein you get introduced to a larger group and probably all other people also knows you. who started Micromax some 20 years back. I will invite all three promoters along with Anuj and Prashant and probably we will have a meeting with the larger set of people. And I think we will take this discussion forward as far as the go-to-market strategy is concerned Prashad and Anuj both being very senior people from the industry so probably I think their insight to the industry will really help you but as far as The technical pitch is concerned. We really like your pitch and it is very promising And we see a lot of great strength in you as an entrepreneur also and as a technical genius also. I think we larger group of people of all four of us along with Prashad and Anod Delhi Jaipur is my second home. So family is there, younger brother is there, 20 years in Delhi. So there hasn't been a single year in the last seven years that I haven't spent like at least two months in Delhi. My life is very globally scattered. I have friends in the US and so on, but Delhi never stopped being a home. So I can be there before the end of the week. That's the only thing I would add to that. And then I think we can have a personal meeting with you. So I think let's wait for another week's time. because two of my promoter friends are traveling to China so they are not here for next four days. So maybe I think we might have to wait until next week. They are flying today, right? So tonight they are flying. So just hang on for some more time and probably I'll arrange the call again and then maybe let's catch up. Because I think you might have to repeat your story again to another set of people. But I think it will be meaningful. I would be very happy to do it, but I'm also very glad to say that such it is picked up this call, so you haven't lost any any inside information or anything from the discussion. Yeah, that's your strength. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay."
0841b18e-fd73-4c67-8947-04ec1bb3f5d1,"where it will automatically detect all the meetings on your calendar. and then it can knock. And then one other feature that we're adding is that. or not join the meetings and leave them alone. for lots of, you know, I would say administration activity. So, but now the objective of the meeting is to discuss the way forward. and how the relation will work. So I like the I like the the solution and I like your personality because you have the passion So we are not trying to repeat something that is already there in the market, you know. And this in order for me to feel the... the ecosystem of such evil. I need to be in that ecosystem. Hello? Yes, I'm here, I'm here. Okay. But at some point I need to build that, you know, to narrow the gap between the client and yourself. So it's not only introduction and that's it. It's more than that. know and it is it is a journey. Let us put it in that way My time is... as evaluated well, appreciated. and I'm utilizing my time in a very good place. So when I put my financial condition, I didn't put too many conditions but also with that conditions you didn't agree but I know that you didn't collect any any fund yet You didn't do any fundraising yet. I know that. but but but in order for you to go to the next level We need to put ourselves in a way that we need. I'm telling you certain things you are telling me we cannot do that. Okay What is your offer to me? I didn't see any offer from your side So, Mr. Majid, I think your last offer was or your last proposal was 3%. With $5,000 like The problem on my side is, currently our burn rate on the product is around 6700. You know, I would say like eight months of burn for us Give or take right so what I to actually be able to put that cash or capital across right on the cash side then I will not be able to self-finance the product for another Like let's say six or eight months. So it's if I have a year of runway set aside for the product with the current level of funding. My intern team is also working for experience. I spend a lot of time and energy coaching them. for free and giving them lots of valuable work experience that's going to help them in their careers. So the situation is if I do put across $5,000 to $10,000 And then such a will become a part-time thing for me, right? So I am also on a shoestring budget. basically reimbursed me to the to the order of around $3,000 to be able to book my flights here. And I'm staying with an elderly lady in an Airbnb. Which is one of the cheapest Airbnb's in the city. So I mean that is that is just a situation of an early stage startup, right? I think where I can offer more flexibility is, you know, you said 3% we could do potentially 4 percent on the materializing of an investment. Right and that is why I am in the other side of the world looking for my my sort of first check in terms of an investment. So yeah, that's just where we are. I don't think it would be a good situation if. I do, you know, take sort of my, so this is, this is sort of my little runway, right? So if I do invest that, and I believe in investing it, so it's not like I'm trying to hold on to hold on to money for no reason. But if I have to invest it and then I have to do another job. Right and I do want to make sure that our clients and our investors get my full-time focus and energy as well right on the product. Right in terms of being able to keep it so because I believe The timeline for realizing funding also takes some time. You might have more experience here, but that is that is my belief So I need to make sure that I can remain somewhat liquid. you know, till that date comes across. One thing we can do is we can also say current terms are fine. once the first investment comes through. So I am fully on board with compensating you for your efforts. Nothing comes for free and I believe in Okay, see again, I just want you to understand that this conversation is to reach to a solution because me and you So and and believe me even I talked to dr. Rishabh And Dr. Rishabh told me, Majid, it's your call. I don't want to interfere in that. So... So, okay, what? Let me, let me... Let me... because the hype is high here in Abu Dhabi. and the subject of AI is increasing here. I know that Sajeev will be one of the interests. of some organizations here and you know I want to introduce you to them But we need to finalize our homework before we go to the people. or you know these kind of things. I don't like doing these things. I either become someone who is with such an achieved team. or no one else. So let me let me analyze the situation today. Today or tomorrow I will come back for you. Also trying to make sure that such a becomes a reality and is successful. So much appreciated. Thank you so much and I would definitely look out for. you know, your offer your thoughts on our conversation. Awesome, awesome. Thank you. you"
bad92662-7853-413b-8238-3c0cdcb80553,"Uh... Cool. Go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to try creating a webhook in Google Cloud. where we should receive the calendar updates. So like, like as in when you make the recall calendar. And then we can run a function that does the stuff to update the calendar according to any updates. So I tried making the webhook. There's a dedication issue. You have to be authorized to call that webhook. I just tested out, try and receive a request from recall. And every time I do make a change to my calendar, It just says it is an authentication issue. I'm not sure how we I'm not sure if there's a way to like get like I've heard checking the recall docs and they don't really specify any way to Yeah, and then when I looked at these resources that I said here, it just said that you can either. You can. which who can access, who can call the webhook, like in the permissions thing here. If we go to permissions, you can try to specify here who calls. What the recall like I'm not sure people feel like this recall guy that's calling the web hook like this Yeah. So, any ideas on how to make an authenticated call to the webhook? Yeah, yeah, if you have any ideas, you can let me know. I think that's enough. Google, what was that? Workspace. Probably can't. So basically, right now, all our Cloud Functions. People have to have the right permissions to call it. So that's why I like these. You don't require any authentication or permissions. So I think, as Adi, as the admin, he could change that permission if he wants to. If we don't want to do that, I'm not sure how to go about authenticating every request from recall. What does Budhu request from Recall have to do with the... Let's see, I just changed this like here. Then, uh. Oh Um But you could also just have an endpoint on the App Engine. In theory, right? Right, so you've provided this address US central one why cycling? Yeah, yes, can also provide another URL to. Yeah, is there a separate service at Google cloud who does that? You could create an endpoint on App Engine. It will also. Receive a request right if you provide the URL you can have like. such as slash calendar webhook, right? And then that could. receive the endpoint if you send it to, if you send it to. that will receive the endpoint. So you could also have something on Cloud Run. that could do it. So like literally anything that receives a post request. can serve as a you can use like another alternate webhook service. on the internet, right? So we've been using one, what was it called? it Swix? It is possible that the issue that you're seeing is very specific to Cloud Functions. Like have you? to be here. Have you checked? So instead of configuring all of our cloud functions, right, across the entire Google Cloud project to then become unauthenticated. Isn't it smarter to just find an endpoint that is actually designed to receive? calls from external agents, right? Because we have other cloud functions. that we probably want to keep authenticated so that they're not exposed externally. OK. run the function that accesses Firestore and updates all the calendar. But why does it have to be non-functional? Uh. can take anywhere upwards of a minute which does not suit an HDB TV web server right because they typically time out between 30 seconds to a minute particularly makes sense to use Cloud Functions for any other reason. It's not like, oh, add a function here for free, contrary to what the name suggests. It has a very specific architectural purpose. And I think trying to use the Cloud Function platform as a cheap and easy way to receive web hooks. externally, okay, that's still doable, but then. in order to do it, deactivating authentication across all cloud functions is like. not really advisable, right? OK, cool. Sorry, I guess what you said, I guess I was under the impression that Cloud Function was just a way for us to do what's probably like. the way we were going about these running functions. Absolutely not. Think Next thing, let me go to... Anyway, I just ended out with my, with this cron job. It seems to be the case, so I didn't have to like... still keeps the credentials vetted, but. The calendar is refreshed token and that seems to be all right. And then if it works for a day, then Yeah, I can look into writing it not locally. What's the issue with that? It's like, I think Recall has like a one hour timeout, I think, on its calendar. So after I update the calendar, with whatever token. After an hour it disconnects and I can't get updates from that calendar anymore. Okay, so when you keep updating it with a cron job once an hour, it doesn't work. Yeah, but like let's say you jump you switch it to a day then Probably like what what what do you expect like will it? Maybe they're a little bit cool. updating the recall calendar. And second thing is keeping my local host. Authenticated. with Google Cloud, so I could keep calling the Google Cloud APIs. So localhost. And Okay, so an architecture where there is no local host for a second, right? The whole purpose of doing this is making sure that Recall can keep accessing the latest calendar in the backend. Yeah, if they can keep doing that and you never have to refresh the token then there's no need for this localhost setup. think like... Give me one second. up And so like, from when I tested this recall calendar, like when I create this calendar, it gets this. This refresh token is actually the access token that we get from. Where is this access taken from? Do Not very well written out for this access, like this updating part. Okay, so like I said, in the authorized code, which is like This token, which is the access token, has to be refreshed every... After an hour it disconnects and doesn't receive the update. That's why I sure doesn't receive the update if you don't refresh it every hour Did you check that? Yes, because like it. It tells you here like when it connects it disconnects and then after more than an hour You can see from 430 to 550, I tried reading. Got it. Something from this recall calendar and it said disconnected. And I got a question now. So Are you calling retrieve calendar every hour and figuring out if it's been disconnected or not? I don't have any like thing automatically right now that this text reader is disconnected but so far I think when you call a... Do they send you a webhook telling you so? Do they inform you that they've been disconnected? Do you receive a webhook with that information? available. Got it. But you do calendar sync events, Do you receive, what's the response? Okay, interesting. Yeah. I'm trying. One hour. I think when I, like when I, Like when I manually run, like just by using like my own, like a code command to. retrieve a new access token. The response always says it's only valid for like 3, 5, 9, 9 seconds, right, which is an hour. And from that, I kind of put two into together. That's why I realized that recall calendar only lasts for an hour. If it's for you potentially with the right token ID. Recall could also run that on your behalf, right? So. We only authoritatively know that. Recall is not able to refresh that token. if we query the recall backend and we categorically know that. Right, via webhook. and it's configured to do so, which you're telling me. It doesn't tell you by default, right? The other is we have to query it. with some periodic checks to make sure that. to keep checking if the token has been updated or not. Which is why I asked you if you are checking the recall backend every hour. if the token has actually expired and if that is actually necessary. Okay, sounds. So I've got a solution. OK. Let me do one thing. So I've got an open communication channel with the the recall backend, the recall tech sub-oating. OK. what I'll do is I'll just add. to this thread Let me know if it came through. Um Oof. a new workspace. I was looking at. It's a new work. It's a new workspace. you in our current workspace. you Okay. Did you get something? Awesome. a channel called Zee Recall Adya. You see it? No, there is just oh yeah. So basically this is an active channel that we have with their with essentially the tech team at recall. So I think there are some like. general questions around how do we keep the token up to date what's possible, what's not possible, right? I think there's another issue Avik's been dealing with, which is I think not all of the changes that we make on the calendar immediately reflect. Their platform partially supports us with whatever we actually need resolution from. five or 10 different problems that we can ask them and probably solve us. I think like, yeah, you just follow through with, like, we'll be able to figure out what that is. And they will be able to tell us what's the best way to integrate and what's the right solution. Right, like the Cloud Function. Yeah, I. I'm not sure we should disable authentication for that. So let's use another webhook point for it. Pune is life a lot easier if you just. I put the call flow in a diagram then trying to run us through like. VS code on a presentation mode, right? also don't have access to this document. As I recall... I think you do but yeah you can shadow shadow link Asked to be editor. We can show it as editor. Yeah, yeah, let's use the official email or Are they two different Google? workspace that we are using. One, I think. Like, add such even add. company and cooperator and then within that So if you email adi at adyawan or if you email Addy at such a way, I'll hit the same. the company address, right? For me, it's an alias. That's what it is, but they're all mapped to the same workspace. They're not different workspaces. All is if you ever create a workspace account Right, so I don't unfortunately have the option of changing it. So when I started to work with these folks. The truth is that it is literally the same email ID. So that's why on I have like an other world which is mapped to my you know, my idea ID addy at other one on the such a one it will give you an Sign saying like this person is external to the organization So interesting. Thank you. Okay. So, Pune, you're match against the document? Yeah, yeah. I was able to access with my search engine, I think. It was my body. I was trying to access it with my personal language. Very cool. Yeah, so yes, I think I'll just wrap up the part. So we'll first see the foot there. I guess I'll try a different endpoint for the webhook and the second part was just keeping the calendar authenticated. Uh. to get a new access token, which I can then use to re-authenticate. Shamu-man. So we're 30 minutes into the meeting and I think a good use of. Everyone's time as we also get meeting, if you have like some reasonably technically complex thing to discuss like help the conversation by bringing in a call flow diagram and so on. Otherwise. It's just not a good use of everyone's time. Okay, got it. I think we'll go for that for now. I'll just quickly run through the last two updates, which is... Yeah, I just made some changes to the calendar because last week the board joined the meeting and left randomly. But I think I'll fix that now. And then second thing is I just. made a bit of a UI template for the meeting history. And this is linked to Firestore right now. But right now our transcripts are save transcripts automatically under the meeting bot's thing. And then this thing fetches those transcripts. It catches those transcripts from Firestore. So it basically checks my email first. And this UI will then fetch it from Firestore and display it here. This is Obviously, we can add a few things. We can add the time something was said, and we can add a bit of search and everything on top of it. So why not also work with the Pune and just get some of this checked in and actually deploy it. Yeah, now I'm hoping that it's still compatible with the code base. So maybe. Like can we even bring it on our Google Cloud? There's a substantial amount of code. that we've got even if some of it is like boilerplate. So I'm not saying like This is nice, but it's still sitting in your obvious code. So it's Okay, which one was it? Which part? I think we were discussing that whether we should do it on cloud run or the auth the project authorization rate, project auth. And then, anything you Yeah, let me, can you just pop that link over to me on Slack? Now, OK. I'm a bit surprised because I feel like I did add Poonam. Let's get that done. Yeah, anyway, that's my update from that side. I just want to make this work and then. Eventually, once the chat's working, the chat will... Actually, eventually, the transcript, we don't... Like I don't think we will plan to save it in Firestore. We plan to save it in whichever vector database we're going to use, which we'll talk more about in a bit. is making some progress, so that's positive. Okay, anyway, so this is all in the dev branch in the repo you created for my notes. So, if anyone wants to check that before we commit that, whatever. Anyway, I think I've spoken quite a lot. No, that's OK. The updates are good. So happy to see lots of progress. Yeah, we should want to go. because we get while entering the query, while entering the. So the schema was not entering properly and I did like There is no proper way to actually check that interview. So I tried with zinus and it actually worked a lot better then we get the query was much faster and I could actually see the schema happening. and the re-ranking and every basically In a nutshell, GeoLinux works much better than the Vivid thing. Once we have the board ID, the transcript will get filtered based on And yeah, also I went through the chat history. It also works well. those transcript histories on the vector store or do we store it on the Firebase. because for example if the user wants to So, do we store on both spaces or only one space? See right now there is no like user. So we can test. We So the way to, so essentially it's like migration planning is your real question, right? we write another method that updates whatever is our vector database, right? And for maybe a while like a week or two assuming adopt like a one week release cycle. Right now we don't have a Major release process either but We'll come back to that. So typically for like a week or two, we use this. Keep both the rights right and then make sure that the Zillers is just And then at some point we can delete the rights to the Firestore. be like a historical archive. that we can just hold on to because it's test data. It doesn't hurt. But for a new user joining the platform, like... Yeah, cool. So I think for the Now I think the list works much better than the previous one. I think it's something you can look into. I've already written the code for it and it actually works much better. Also while sending the query via the OpenAI maybe it was some kind of like this does not exist in that because the chunking mechanism works much better with zilus and nanshin as combined we can integrate this for now on the chat. Awesome. Cool, thanks for sharing this. So yeah, I think there's an opportunity to kind of connect the front end now. All right. the list, like if we are deploying the list. deployment either on Google Cloud or AWS. For now, I think Google Cloud works for us because we've been working on that. Cool. Thanks, Rishit. I've shared editor permissions on the Cloud project with the server-side info editor and it's the same as Uh, other shift. Assign rules. Yeah, I think you've just got editor permissions, which is great. So yeah, you can create Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, whatever it is. So that's kind of possible on Google Cloud. Yeah, we talked yesterday and he was like, what is the next step? I told him that Adi is going to reach out to you by the end of the week. So make sure to go back to him and I like him. I'm not sure if you run any take thing called screening I just ask if he knows Python and I said yes So other than technical background, I really like him. The whole point was for you to assess if he's going to be a net technical asset, right? He's a very nice guy. I think he'll be a That's your decision because if he's not technically strong then that's all the problems that come with that. decision than also yours, right? So it's a balancing act. Because also like he's early in his career right like he's going into a second year now Yeah, so I think he will learn a lot he learns pretty quickly So obviously the technical screening will not be like, you know, like. like Apple or something. At the same time, I think fine tuning of some LLM models, which is not that like. Python heavy. Mostly logic heavy. So then, like there's not much to be done, right? Like you can just assign a project to him. a break. Yeah. Awesome. So that's good news, folks. We've got another person joining the dev team. So we've got like more muscle across the team. Awesome. One more thing I wanted to discuss with you all. was folks, please check out this app called Read. Just try the trial version and join a few meetings with it. The reason I say this is... That's an example of my notes on steroids. Like it's it's just an extremely powerful. I mean, okay Pune. I know you might Say that you know I like it and I I read user reviews It offers these days people have people have future fatigues and they really want their app to be as simple as possible. That's how something like TikTok gained a lot of popularity in their first kind of release. useless feature and it's like so kind of confusing. But other than that, themselves is like chief meeting officer and like. What Read that. So the point of sharing this is not Like we have to beat them, right? The point of sharing it is like, here's a feature-ish. feature rich SAS version of what we're trying to do, which. Some people like and some people don't right so they have mixed reviews. We should be aware of what's in the market What are people paying for it? They have one or two of our own that makes us special and different from them. But we should know how it works and at least try it. So that's why I was suggesting that it's worth taking a look at what they're doing. You'll get some ideas. And some things you learn, like I probably wouldn't build it that way. So that's entirely okay, but we should not be aloof. that it doesn't exist, right? Definitely play with it, try it. I agree, it's got too many features. I don't... At the same time when I use it I was like holy shit like they've... engineered the shit out of this, right? And maybe we want... Some of that maybe we don't. I've not come up with an opinion there, but it's worth All of us at least trying it. So the trial is free Couple of things that were really interesting was the onboarding flow. So when you're onboarding. Is it easy it is to start with because that's a like for a lot So I think they handled that really well. Then I also got another piece of feedback. Again, this is not my notes related. This is a bit such a related but It was basically. the sooner we have like a differentiated product. We still need to get to a point where. We have meeting summaries and accuracy and retrievability and searchability. But then the next step after that, I think the first integration. But I think that will be that one sort of integration that will unlock things for us. Cool. And then the last It But they have but There are different apps and different apps specialize in different things, right? What they have done is they've gone very, very deep in meeting intelligence in general, abstract meeting intelligence, right? So it's like a version of my notes on steroids which simplified version of it. Think about all the Apple ecosystem apps that you use. There's still some product opportunity there. So I'm not saying we copy all of 3D AI, but understanding what is. We will probably cover a fraction of this with high polish. and then start to specialize in the project management space. So we haven't reached that point yet, but it's good to be aware of what our market. and playing fielders. Awesome. So we spoke a bit about Derek, we spoke a bit about Reed. that I want to set up with Pune. So this meeting was on the slot that. Essentially the one-on-one sort I had with Poonam will agree on. on another time to just connect weekly or maybe. whatever is suitable. But yeah, that's a thread that, so Pune I noticed you had an input on the things we should do on the pitch stack as well. I think a good way of going about it is so. Let's. and align on what updates we need on the deck and what's our outbound. and I've just put it on hold because I wanted more complete than it was like maybe a couple of weeks ago. So yeah, happy to close the dots there. So we'll just agree on some time and follow up. Sounds good. I sent you the bio on Slack if you haven't received it. So one awesome thing that Prakriti does is she leads this Europe if not the UK. Okay. And so All of her non-LSE work, her non-LSE SAS tools. So when you log into such a meeting using your personal ID. Then I know that like, it's just okay. It's not a big deal. It's actually nice that we have a good network across like student bodies. So And so that sort of organic growth is also kind of nice. like professionally oriented and technical and you know driven but also social. and they have like a community around them which I think is a cultural win for us. things you think would be helpful for the team to work on between now and the next iteration. I mean, there'll be like one-on-one follow-ups, but just maybe like if sort of a schema design. Figure or something like that. for me to get on board faster and people who are kind of and get rid of the ones that are extra because at some point we want to go to an enterprise market. We really need a neat and clean code that is like quickly. If we need to debug something, we can do it quickly. And that's what I have in my thought and then for Drake I'm gonna have ask him to put together some small, small app to just kind of... test on some of the features that we are going to build and As you mentioned, like, read AI. has like 50 features, we're gonna pick five. So we wanna. quickly build a few of them to see which one is kind of. your sort of mode of operation is like, oh, let's build it. Let's build the whole thing in a week, right? And now that I think you've like seen some of the code and like. That's actually what I'm trying to do. So with drag we want to kind of build one feature in one week, see if you like it and build another feature in one week. So sort of using whatever is available rather than building. things from the sky. So, that's what I think. That's kind of flow back into is. Like we can now think about as you get more comfortable with like some of the architecture and the team and so on, like think about. Let's say we say like three weeks from now we plan a launch. So all of us will have some work. That we need to do in the three weeks. Maybe we get to not a lunch lunch, but lunch for kind of individual users. I know enterprise apps Honestly, even that would be freaking amazing. If we get to like. So we can do like very lightweight marketing and. and get that, right? But then the tricky thing will be retaining them. So like... someone goes and sing like record some videos of singing on TikTok then you can kind of. Have a clickable link to our products. That's Okay, getting me to sing and perform requires like a... And what will happen is if we have that kind of line in the side, that we'll do some sort of launch on a particular date. the members across the team will become a bit more clear. So then we can keep ourselves accountable to that. and then use this time a bit better. I mean, still early days, right? It's good. So how's the first week been, Puran? How's... How are things coming along? That's good. I was a little bit Beard and my usual and had like very little time to spend on it, but I'm such a thing but so far so good. One more thing that I had is like, if there is any network, we see networking event around. a lot more luck connecting with people that I need to. in person or face to face rather than sending cold email and I was like a true cold outreach. So that's why some of them claim they themselves and Quora. I was thinking maybe we want to go that route as well if there is anything in... person that we could attend that goes a long way. It's like for me, I never live. Networking with meeting empty handed. So I've had like a lot of luck in that. So I'm planning to visit the US sometime end of this month early next month. So sometime around potentially 26th August to No, 26th July to the first week of August. So I haven't fixed my exact dates yet, but I'm planning to be there so we can definitely identify like some VC events I mean, I can change my dates to accommodate a VC event. if it's happening around that time. We can go to it together, but otherwise. some of the elements of the pitch. I'm not going to say anything specific just like So the way it works with VCs is just building genuine relationship rather than, oh, hello, I have this company that I need funding for. So I'm like, oh, this is me. How are you doing? Let's keep in touch. And then I'll. Cast them like after a couple of those sessions. I'm gonna pass them to you to kind of explain. What is your plan? But happy to see your progress across the team and excited about Excited about next steps. Pune, it's great to have you on board and also excited to bring Derek along. So I'll definitely poke him. and set them up so we can I mean adding them to the workspace is like five minutes. for me but like I think the good way the best way to kick him off will be to Maybe give them like a one pager or like a half pager saying like this is a project your startup project I have written that I shared some of it so I'm gonna so I'll I'll write it in one page and send it to you. perfect, awesome. Thank you everyone. Yeah, thanks to you. Bye. See you. See you guys. Bye."
f9c5e4d7-e4e8-411f-9b42-404c6960f006,"So I'm actually happy to get your thoughts. So you said we should meet, so I've got my team here. And we'd love to hear what you have in mind. Just hold or a few minutes so we can make it quick. Chotem. How's y'all David? Busy, So spoke to a bunch Okay. you You No worries, that's okay. So tell me. So Rajesh, from the email that we sent you, I don't have any further updates. I did mention to you that on Trinity we have to part ways with Robert because he's not So we have been reaching out to, in fact, we posted the roll guard. taken down in like three hours because it just filled out the application. So I've shared a few, like an assignment with a few questions. The difficult thing for us now is to choose from some really good candidates. That's a good problem to have. How is that something that? we can start using it or is it waiting for? It depends on what is it and how much it is that you need. So I shared in the email back to you. Yeah, yeah, I've not looked at it. You know, I didn't go through the list now it can join Google Meets. the Google Meet stock and it can call APIs. We haven't actually connected it to any APIs yet, but we get structured JSON objects. through which we can call any APIs we want. So can build it for Zoom and Teams. I think that will take us about two to three weeks. That's my estimate. side of things. Rishit is on the tech team. Hey guys, nice to meet you. here is, so it can join the call. Rajesh, in honesty, connecting it to Jira is like two or three days a week. It's not a big deal. The problem is we task deplication, quality management, those kind of things. What we don't want is, oh, we connected to your D and it breaks or both. That would be not a good user experience. So in the MVP roadmap that we shared with you, there were a few other checks that you would have added. store all the actions or verification layer. So if you're not confident about what you're talking about, it will actually ask you. like here, we want me to do that, then you can decide in the meeting or give command and then it will go to it. So those checks will make the user experience much more viable. If you want, like if you wanted to just join a Google meet like yeah, just share your calendars with us and you'll probably have something happening in a week. And so where we are. And I'm very happy with both the models. We can start working closely. next week itself but I do want to manage your expectations around like the quality of the product is today. We can also support other, if you want to use MS Teams, we can spend, I think it will take us about two, three weeks to build that integration. We can do that. And then we'll also make some features like a dashboard, right? To just kind of see the history of edits and those kinds of things. a few desktop agencies so we can outsource the Sermon Touch with an agency in Romania. I just shared the work with an agency in India. to complete the work and I'm trying to get a quote. And in parallel, I'm trying to fundraise. So we can pay the agencies. So I mean, you Sorry? What kind of skills are you looking for for this guy? We just need web development. So web development achieves, I think about 70-80% of the MVT. We also need some machine learning expertise. They are specialized in LLM and AI models. So we have a head start on the LLM piece, but we... And the problem is I'm very strong with like marketing and investor calls right now because of So that's kind of where we're placed in terms of a talent availability point of view. I'm putting a new that is focused on delivering agents, right? Pure AI agents to our industry. And I'm doing it for multiple roles. whether it's in the banking side, whether you're doing an account opening, whether you're doing financial advice. Whether you are doing a teller a back office central operations or a loan origination. train them with that particular skill set. and deploy those agents. And I want to see, starting again, we are not going in and saying. your project manager will be replaced. Eventually we would, but for now... Here is an assistant to your project managers. So we could basically have them one project manager and have these four. assistance or whatever who can kind of support them. That's the vision. And I'm not building the tech of these agents, which is again, I'm leveraging. For on your end, I'm looking at a pure. program manager, project manager, kind of an agent. putting on a capturing things following up. But because currently another reality is in our industry where I'm working. There are probably, I'll say, experienced individuals. who are about to retire. sitting on a lot of those project management roles. follow-ups, take the stick and run behind people. did the role for three years. Nobody else knows how to bet. They are the big mommy is off the a company, right? Like they know how to get things done. kind of disrupt that space and bring these. as an assistant initially and then start. doing that role full time. That's why for me, to kind of add your agent. and kind of introduce it that way, not basically sell them. an agent or sell them a tech, but make it part of our team. when we are engaging with our customers as part of the project. and slowly expand and kind of in a... bring those agents to their other projects. That's why I'm asking you like when can we start? kind of at least introducing it to do the basic things. Yeah. But I think you're focused more on the building this well-trained project manager, program manager. is what would be a differentiator for us. So you mentioned you have other agents. So one thing we recognize in some scenarios we'll be calling APIs. In some other scenarios we will be giving structured work to other agents to complete which are better trained at doing that specific work. So one is, do you have something that is able to attend your meetings and get at least the raw data out of them audio video feeds in the transcript. or an important system goes down and email comes to an inbox, right? So now we have this RPA bot. get triggered as soon as the type of an email comes. to that inbox, right? As soon as it, so this particular bot would go in. set up a Zoom meeting and make a... call literally a phone call and an SMS to a group of people asking them to join this meeting. And when they join this meeting, the bot would also join the meeting. and take the attendance. kind of update report in our app, it would basically say. This was these are the list of people I send the invite. This is who my called and this is what they responded. And these are the people who joined that meeting. And then once. It's a zoom recording, right? Once the zoom recording is done. download that file, use some transcript video to text. take that and go to OpenAI, summarize it, and give that information. That's very important. responsible person who can take it and do whatever. I don't know if you have heard of Cintasia. Sorry, not Cintasia. Synthflow is in a... call making agent, right? Like you can use as a support agent. It can have conversation with someone or call. or sales lead, call them and have a conversation. The AI agent will make a call, have the conversation. Nothing different. You're making a call, taking the transcript. your intentions are from there and filling up some forms behind the scene. and taking certain actions. But I could currently, our team has built something that. having a conversation, we build these RPA processes behind the scene. So we are... and understanding their intent, triggering these APIs and... getting that work done from these parts behind the scene. It's it's you know more often leading with automation. And that's it. That's where the future is and future is not about making people efficient anymore. that the goal is to replace these people. So that's my two and where. You know you delivering when a today you might be delivering just a program manager I don't know what your future roadmap, how do we expand it? That's where I want to see how we can collaborate. and take this agents. And we are trying to be the first in the industry within this industry to bring AI agents to. to this banking industry because we have been there for the last five years. very deep and understand their backend systems. I think so. I think so. I think they're not, um... So we have been talking in the context of providing such as to your customers. And there is a vision of integrating with financial APIs and being able to close these processes. That might be like a finance program manager or maybe a slightly different We'll kind of start. Get distracted on that. Yes, we can do that. But for us, get me follow up with people kind of let's because Once we kind of build that expanding that and other areas is just different APIs, different conversation, different data. training different, then we can expand it to other areas. Yeah One thing I just want to clarify, that's doable. That's the roadmap on which we are going. message people and give you a recording and so on. Is that already deployed for you? I mean, it's a rudimentary RPA process built. It took us one week to just build that. integrated with Tulio to make those calls. or basically programmed an RPA to log into Zoom and set up the meetings and do that. So it's a... it's not a product or something that I don't call because we are using UI path behind the scenes to do that. With you, my vision is the same thing can be done with your agent who might call an API of Zoom to schedule those meetings and. That's it. What we have done. and deployed is, or even not deployed, we have still. for deploying an agent who can just do that one thing. curiosity when you sit When you say RTI Rajesh, are you talking about using something like Selenium browser and like No, no. know you are part in the context of front end, but my question is more are you trying to simulate like when action on those tools? The capabilities might be a little limited. UiPath is a product designed for... UX based automation, right? So it literally. We are not ready with a B2C like self-serve checkout application. That will require us a roadmap of three months. but we can do something that is on-prem. On-prem becomes easy for us because we'll effectively just come and deploy some code. right on your systems and then like customize it to your use case, right? That way, you are in control. or data stays in your cloud. We can also then, but then that would require access so we can sign in India and those kinds of things. And then we can start to just execute on a roadmap together. So I think the part that you mentioned on a report on a weekly basis. you can attend all your meetings. If you already have a view account, you can look for like downstairs conversations. These things are very doable for us. We can definitely do it. us I want you to kind of focus on or some other project management tool that companies might be using. Connect to that, get the status on it. What are the open tasks on the sprint? What are those kind of APIs it should be able to get in? bring me the summary of data, right? That's it. There is a lot. on that area, right? Because project manager... has a bunch of tools, a bunch that they use. a bunch of things that they regularly do in a kind of. Let's focus on that. If we are able to deliver. And that's exactly what we want to take. whether this is deployed on our cloud or on the customer cloud or... And how we deploy it, that's a secondary. But let's just have it. I understand. I understand. So I get a sense of your requirements like. What is the long-term goal? I think we are aligned in terms of the product we want to build. I'm trying to approach things more tactically now because I'm responding to your question. It's like, when can we get started? So I shared an MVP list with you that I'll get for the next three months. we can start building out that MVP. When I say on-prem, part of it is. You can test it immediately and tweak it. That's the vision there. I can deploy a team of two. So they can start working on. And then in three months, we will aim to still hit the same MVP milestones that I've already shared with you. But I'm responding to that sort of practically. as with all AI and machine learning solutions, it is going to make some mistakes in the beginning. then we can go on that journey together of improving it and then making it the best in the market. or would you prefer that we just build something for MS Teams? Whatever client you use the most. Microsoft Office where Microsoft Calendar and those, that's the. Usage and 90% of our customer are a Microsoft shop. They have all the calendar this in a some may use different things for meetings like zoom or And Outlook basically scheduling a meeting and doing that in the Outlook. So that's been kind of a key. And Zoom is the second option. Zoom because Microsoft Teams have certain conflicts with internal or external vendors. or with anyone, this is what we get output. I get a good visibility on it. And if we can take that and... in a start putting it on our on our meetings where I do with my team internally. Do you want to see this for Google Meet or do you want to see this for MS Teams? I mean, I and my team can start looking at it on what it can deliver to us. as an immediate until you build something for the. So one thing I can try and do is. I can try providing a bit of a summary of what we got out of this meeting from Sachin. determines like next steps. It will give a transcription of the. and then we can create various different types of summaries for you. Once you have the basic transcription you can have 15 types of summaries. Sending an email summary back to you after that, not a problem. Identifying action items is something that we've not done a lot of quality analysis on. We have the option items reserved, but we don't use them right now. Okay. OK. Yeah. I think let's, uh, you know. If you can share what you got out of it. and then give me to try.... from these project management tools. It's just another note-staker for now. Yeah, yeah, we are on Microsoft Office. Are you? drive folder, sorry, sky drive, one drive folder. with us. And what do we do? So what we will need is we will need basically an account which has some access to APIs. but it can be going to certain resources. So we need the ability to create a document. We have to write to those documents. You can read those documents as well. Ability to share permissions on the documents created. Another thing we can do, just thinking about this is. Provision the ability to get the bot into the meetings that you are like give you the ability to invite the bot at least into Google Meetings. This is a feature we need to build. I think that's another like couple of weeks of dev work. So just setting some expectations here, but if you can share these things with us. a slight an account and I'll let you know and an account that you want to be able to invite giving you a sample of the kind of summaries that we can send back to you. OK. OK. Makes sense. Let's do that. Look, my whole goal is, I think, to say that. I'm encouraging a lot of Indian-based tapped and a lot of fluff outside there. I feel we... We guys do a real hard work and I think there is a great opportunity for, you know. And let's figure out how to win in this. I appreciate that. Absolutely, Rajesh. And definitely. I really value the continued interest you've shown in us and the patience as well. I appreciate. We could definitely move faster. And I have a very good, again, I don't know how much bandwidth. My team might have to help you, but we have a good. design for applications in a... Really good guys who have been with me for some time if If there is something that you need, we can kind of... But let's see what needs to be done at least for us to move forward. They can build something as long as you have the APIs that they can use. Rajesh, I think one thing that would be extremely good synergy. It will also be a very good communication tool. One of the things we need to build for such is a dashboard. We'll control the bot, like join this meeting, don't join. Show me the notes for the last five meetings. How long was the meeting? Who attended the meeting? All those things you mentioned. We haven't landed the design for the dashboard yet. So I think your design resource is actually a win-win. So that can actually save us a couple of cycles of maybe we didn't build the right thing and those kind of things. We have currently a product called Align Excel that we deploy to our customers. And in every new AI tech I'm bringing, I'm kind of... putting a new menu item there and a new UI. for doing the test. So I will add kind of an. Align PM or Align Project Manager as the new option and we will have the UX designer. If you have some ideas that you have already written down for this dashboard, just send it an email. I will see how it fits on what I'm looking for. And we can just ask the guide will do a great job on. designing it for a product that you can leverage it. I have a list of some of the functional expectations out of the dashboard. For example, I want a summary of all the last X meetings. Yeah. And just You have it MVP. Yeah, I mean, we can add more detail there. But I've also taken the trouble, I've not just listed features, I've actually written them as user journeys. As a person in XYZ, I want to use product XYZ to achieve ABC, whatever. So I think that is the right language for a designer. A designer should be able to... study that and come up with a design. that would be better. I'll set up a call. Let me review that with him. Next week. I'll talk to him and then we'll set up a meeting with him. Let's share what we want to show in this dashboard. and we can get it done. Sounds good? Sounds good? One thing we'll do Rajesh, we'll send you the summary and the details from this meeting. Yeah, yeah. What the bot picked up. I'll look out for the call with your design team. Office 365 Outlook calendar. I'll also ask you to email ID you want to use, the Gmail ID you want to use for using Google Meets. That's and the OneDrive account and the resources that we can. and build for you. So I think we have like three, four action items. We can take things forward. Yeah, OK. OK. All Let's get this going. Nice meeting you, guys. That's a different name. Tough one. All right. Nice meeting you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so team I have at least. From Monday, I'm going to be in a nine to five program trying to raise money for us How do I know this? like we don't raise capital if I code. I can code. That's not a problem right? How do we do this? Do you feel confident about building this? Like you've been wrestling with a... open source deployment for like three weeks now. I know I'm not being critical. I'm not like this thing, but like it's a challenge. Yeah, I think we can So one thing we need to do very urgently is get the calendar sync going. There is no reason to not do that. Right? Yeah. Calendar sync is extremely important both on in the JSON that we used to call recall backend. Yeah. Actually, let me remove this board. I don't know if this is the ideal way to go about this. I know like. Today..."
f0327d39-77f4-476a-a854-8db2b5969f6d,"What's happening? Am I audible, Rishabh? Yes, yes. I think I can hear you. I think there's a bit of a lag in the call, but I think we'll manage. Okay. Um... seen the NVIDIA startups thing. It's a standard program, right? Yeah. It's not like a. partnership or anything. It's a standard program thing. Yeah, for that only that special partnership we need to have that meeting. She just shared that to me just to look over. Preferred pricing. I said it's just fine. venture capital is okay. Yeah, it's just I don't know how much exactly like how much credits are we actually getting Let's start the... Okay. What are the terms? of this application, get started as friends. FAQ let's look at the FAQ it how much is the membership cost no fee Yes. Offer members discounts on in workshops is fine. A repository of self-paced AI and deep learning training courses. This is training course I'm required to provide about my funding status. currently generate any revenue. Um, yeah, dude, I need to set up our, uh, like Dubai entity in order to do this because the company I need to figure out like the corporate structuring before we go down like taking a finalist. I'm speaking to another consultant on like an XPCG partner Thank you. to understand what is the proper way to structure the organization, and how the resources are going to be placed within as well. Even in setting up the AWS account, setting up the appropriate permissions model and everything is a pain. Because that needs to be done in accordance with the corporate structure as well. So there's a lot. lot here to think about. And it's not really easily possible to do all of this while still like doing like solving bugs on the platform, right? So I need I need to bring someone in who can take that responsibility before I, because once I move into a CEO role, then I will not have the capacity to manage the CTO role. So I really need someone, that's the thing. So I'm talking to a few candidates. I mean like The technology we are building is the one we are going to use. But how do we... Yeah, that's kind of where we're at. Actually, like, Sachit should pick this up in the AI transcript. So hopefully that works. Yeah, but they We need to send her a question and we need to ask her. Um... happening with this. Let me check one thing really quickly. Okay, but we haven't received any like objects from open AI as yet. there's something that came. No objects from open air. Fascinating. Yeah, I thought the AI layer would be working. for some reason it's not working. I'll just check it really quick. So I'm also like testing the. And I'm saying, oh, we need to send them an email. I was expecting a pop-up. Hi, Havik. Sorry, hi, Havik. You just joined a. right in the middle of the meeting. So the application. This is the product. This is in production. So the transcriptions are fine. It's like real time now. But when I say, hey, we should schedule this meeting next Tuesday, or we have this meeting next Tuesday, and before that, we need to send an email. We absolutely need to send an email. I'm not gonna do this anymore. It has come, right? So that's pretty cool. It is kind of working, but it's not very reliable. So we need to like train it. email them and ask them if the company that. actual legal entity that we are going to enroll or take funding in. edit or like build the server out of. Is that a problem? Is it too premature? connect with them maybe one month from now. that question needs to. So I'll take up a task. Actually, you know what, we'll see all the prompts that came for this meeting because that's also I also checked in the storage of the tasks into Firestore. Firestore has the transcript and the tasks OpenAI created. So now we're getting some actual data from our calls. And the question is like, how do we actually improve it? So we're creating some of that initial training data that we can use. But that data needs to be labeled. Like this task was good, this task was not good. need to start fine tuning it. But at least we can start creating data, which I'm really happy about. at least from our internal conversation. So coming back, oh, but that also reminds me, we need to think about encryption or data. Some meetings are safe to record. Some meetings are not safe to record. And so we need to have a way of marking meetings that we can use for training purposes. So by default, it should all be not for training purposes. So we need to have a way of marking meetings that we can use for training purposes. So we should encrypt the data on the move. Next. Getting like before we put this out there and anyone with a Google ID can just sign in and just logged in, access to our data. That kind of instrumentation also needs to be there. Yeah, there's a lot of work to do on this side. before we actually go live. Yeah, I think this is a question. So I'll email her back. was the we'll move the meeting. Like if she says it's not a problem, then we meet on Tuesday and we just have like an intro call. If she says it's a hard requirement. then I will probably tell her like we should have this conversation like in one month. So that then when we get to a point where, I mean, in fact, I need to do that anyway. So I'm already speaking to like a couple of accountants and everything and looking at whether we can open up an entity. Right, so that's fair, that's like an example. task to complete. Coming back to the notes. So then Baraukar was asking for a demo screenshots video. So you can definitely do that. One thing I want to do after this call is, oh, so one thing it does is like, let's see, touch any ID activated. And then when I activate it, these two messages come on. Yeah, that's true. Right, so one thing I want to do is I'm going to. try bringing another bot into this meeting so that the history is not shared. and hopefully it gives us a fresh history for the meeting. I actually don't know, I haven't tested its behavior. And Yeah, I just come and record 30 seconds flip meeting notifications. You know what's really cool? I can actually... data equals to, let's do it this way. So I can do this from command nine. So we can also sort of fabricate demo a little bit. do our own version of Gemini, you know? Yeah. OK, so yeah, let's go through the rest of the agenda. And then we'll record the demo at the end. Sure. Also, like, this is working on, so I think just coming to your first point on the agenda, this is working on almost no context. Every, every box that you see here, right, the blue box, the gray box, it's a... The vector database will be created for that. So from that only it will extract the data. some database, but across the database, we need to maintain like a meeting ID and so on. For Lama it is 4k only. Beyond that, we could use a mistril. the new API, which also cost apparently. And we could also, OpenAI we are using, so it has a context of 16-gb. has a very low word extent. For that I was thinking like we can cut the wording into like chunks. Yes, I did. What was the behavior like? Did you take any artifacts from that It was going on and it was working perfectly fine. What I did was I downloaded the content. exploration? There was a time scale, so time series kind of thing. version of the gamma. So it is already downloaded on the Ubuntu server, the remote server that we have. So instead of calling the API. actually downloaded that into the... The remote channel is like... 500 GB. Yeah. Yes. And but the thing is what we are, maybe I'll just share one thing. We're going through the server that we have. We have used in through. Bye bye. Cool. Actually, I have a question about the context. By context, you mean like, is the context going to be just the whole meeting itself, or is it also going to have some information from past meetings, maybe? You see what tasks have been created before, oh? It needs in the context of chat, right? And like then in-meeting contacts can also become richer. Like what are the expressions of this person? Like facial expressions of this person. Are they angry for, do these questions mean they're angry or stressed out about something? data And that so, are coming you in that are contextual, know, like. right? And then context is also like, how packed is this person's calendar? If they're like really, if Richard's busy with something this week, then you can't add more stuff to it. And one of them is one part of that is just actually looking at the stuff on the calendar. But like as a program manager would do, it's also understanding that just because this is like one meeting doesn't mean that it's, you know, just that hour that you're actually in the meeting, this meeting needs like three days of preparation for it. It's like in context, you know, it's a very important thing. being able to make decisions around. So like, this is the roadmap, right? Like it's a product that will not. Like even if we are not working on it four years later, and if we like sell it and exit, right? The team that picks it up will eventually build something like this because that is the nature of the, if they're still using it as a program manager. So that is the... part of the product roadmap in and of itself. So context will grow indefinitely with time. But yes, the short answer is we need to support contextual and the earliest and quickest win there is, yeah, just trying to get like all the messages from one user into a call. That's why the code that I've checked in. But what happens is that the server, when you provide something like 32,000 characters in the query, and it's looking at other messages in the thread as well, then its responses start taking minutes. At least on So what happens is on the front end, you'll send a query. And you're going to get them. And they don't even have a. like cheap open-air stuff. a webhook model, like OpenAI has not released webhooks. So they are not even taking the responsibility of like letting your client know when they have processed the query you send them. So you have to keep pulling them and get a reply. And it takes like eight minutes for them. And the polling says the task is like pending assigned to a work. It literally returning like their worker model, exposing their worker model on an API. And then you're like, oh, this worker is actually done. Now I'll query the data object inside that worker and then extract my. you manage the state of what data has been processed or has not been processed. on the client side. So actually, this is a really good point for me to also show you in Bitbucket itself, I have shared a diagram. Um, That's good. link in the chat and also in the notes. link. There's no any that's weird. request is, uh... Flank side. There is the initial fetch which figures out if there were any historical chat items against this call in the URL, who signed in, who signed out. Is he coming back? You're in my toilet. By the way, did you check the login broken? It was broken. the pull request I left some comments on it. We can also discuss that really quick. because I also need to talk about that. So. Yeah, I was saying that this is all the context management that we are even doing on the client side, right? So it's not just about the AI, it's about how the rest of the app also responds to that context. So like you make the initial. call from the server you get like the existing chat items on that call or at least what we understand that call to be right so that itself is like how do you figure out what is the most relevant call for the user right when they provide a meet ID. And I think it might be, I might be doing something stupid on the transcriptions object side, right? Like maybe I'm not folding that data correctly. So maybe it's worth doing a short experiment, just figuring out like what kind of data objects are going there. on the front end it does this condensing where it deduplicates the items based on a logic that's in a similarity candidate. It's a very naive logic, but this logic itself can become very sophisticated later, right? Like figuring out like who the actual speaker is and what is the final thing they actually said. a certain percentage of the sentence, we need to deduplicate them. the final thing. boundary and those of a chunks blue box are and a gray then box. centers like So those chunks then are bucketed. the logic for that is actually in message items to groups. So that's also a really important method, which determines that these collection of individual translation responses is actually one group of speech. And then it combines that to the minute granularity-ish, roughly. Like if the speaker changes, it can be shorter. But all of those are singular chunks. And then there is another AI layer which triggers once a minute. And it looks at like, what are the unprocessed chunks or articles that I have? and then sends them to a single call. So, and then if we get an instant response, then you're like going through the entire message history, like chunk by chunk by chunk, right? Whereas if you get a response like eight minutes later, right, then figuring out what... was even like because so much has changed and happened since you can understand like Context management. Yeah, so saying oh you have a task or context It'll be nice to you should have set up like a test asana know see what kind of stuff and I also want to do one more thing which is like end of meeting summary right so when the once the bot has been ejected Maybe we'll do one thing where like for the media. But for Asana, we need a kind of such an account for to access the API. Because from my side, I can do my API. From your side, you can do your API. But for a character API, yeah. Create an account and send you the keys or something. And then you can check those. And that's OK. But anyway, I wanted to show like, Avik, you asked a very simple question, right? What about context management? It's a deep thing, right? Like this is just the beginning of the context management problem. and then different solutions will. require a completely different design top to bottom. So that's why I, because. Without this diagram, it'll be extremely difficult to explain what code have I already checked in. And then my expectation is that when we start checking in code, we also document the same kind of things so that the... Now let's, so with this done, let's go to the PR really quick pull request. Let's go do it. Oh yeah, this one. this app context and this is brought is coming from the helper. as it goes. Okay. So if we go back. in the helper. It checks if the environment is Google Clouds, right? And then it tells you that it's in production. It does not know what URL it is. It doesn't care what it is. But this is a, and eventually, we will expand this. production server. There is Lungohost. And there There will is be a a variable deployed called web is production server. that So I can always now, call. so far, we were working in a world where this was a binary. But now, this is going to be like a map or a list of different servers we're going to have. So now, the question is, how are we using this problem? So what it did is it just added this to the context processor. So basically, this means that every request that comes to this web page. in my because I am production and client server like. Local client and client production means different, and local server and local production means different things, right? And there's also pre-deployment server. And that's why when I come back here, now there are multiple links. So I think we can use like Y Cycling app. whatever as a deployment development, pre-deployment development server kind of thing. But you know, it's not AI, it is production. So the thing I wanted to show you was if you come to the landing page now, this is the part where. when it checks this variable. Is it production? This is where it's coming from, from the class server. So... So it's got to be one when the server is Google App Engine. But now we don't care about that. Like we do care about. we need to know like what is the actual URL that I'm hitting. Where is the client running? Is the client running? Is the client querying like a wise? URL. it on production production. the entire logic needs to change. And then obviously the syntax is wrong. I was trying to put in the server URL that by maybe we're doing this, it will the login will be some of it. Yeah. But I get your point. Yeah, I get your point. So there's a broader point. But like this is not even like, there's not even JavaScript. The seed if you did, if you put this, it will give you an error in the console. Yeah. Yeah. So I think, okay, I'll push this fix in. Like I'll jump off this call and like push this fix in. what is the server host, right? The back host, which could be local, it could be production, it could be pre-deployment, et cetera. And both of them could be different things, right? That's the whole point. So I'll push in a change to fix this. That's going to be fine. Added the same for API calling, which is fine. So yeah, so coming back to the, I'm looking at the meeting notes now. What is the, what is it? You want to demo the API? Do you want to take over presentation mode? Yeah, let's try it over there once I finish up this call. I'll... Share it with you. So for Miami-Tex, I'm talking to a few other engineers looking at a notarization contract. So there is one potential use case we can solve with a notarization project. I'm like working on a design for that. create some cash flow for us in India. That could be really nice. That means that we can at least get a first client and it's going to be a pretty big one. I'm just working on that. My conversations with the US-based automation company is also maturing. I'm going to do some kind of. to figure out how we can use their platform and how do they benefit from us. So work through some of the details of that. So, NVIDIA, okay, so one, two, so. to end video. for cooperation with China for a year. The corporate structure, you see that. And there are a couple of other things. I mean, like encrypting data and all that is like a more long-term thing. Actually, it'll be nice to. What were you showing me on instance two types? I will Yeah, so the current one what we are using is in to xlarge the first one So what it has, it has only like, there's no GPU in it too. So there is one thing called Neuron. and Neuron. Neuron is basically the version of a GPU we can call it So there we have. what we used is hint2.xlarge Here we have two neuron core. we move on to a much larger model like llama. So for 70B this doesn't work. So for that we would require the into the second last one to 24x large. So this has 6 to 12 cores of neurons. So that will work for that. That was what I was searching for. make sense. So the thing is like, what is the benefit of going from Lama 7b to 7tb? It's accuracy, right? there's more data for data involved in that so more data is trained on that. For now, I think that's not really required. it. And like the other thing I need, you. for both of you to think about is like, actually, right now, the bottleneck is context window. 4K is a starting point. Understanding that article length, how does it fit into? What is the typical article? Every query that I send, how much? I think, let me see if I... I'll share a link with... okay let me just present. So there are like some objects with like an empty... I'm a bit surprised there aren't more documents here. I was expecting there to be a lot more. All right. is a time stamp thing. this is a very urgent thing to fix on the product side and then. doing, Rishabh, like it's good, like looking at different models. But right now I just want us to think about, firstly, get the API sorted. And then think about, can we at least, don't even worry about like a million other kinds of contacts, just worry about like, can I at least get the whole meeting contacts in? At least my meeting is saved, I'm not recreating the same tasks over and over again. And I can do a dedupe, but not on the translation side, but on the AI side. Or rather, we never even create that task. So we can keep our requests to the, well, we are not going to be bottled on additional requests. It's going to be very cheap to call that inference server. Dude, now I'm like... So pissed off with myself for like the shitty code that I checked in. We could have had all the tasks that got created in this meeting, like in the database. And I'm just like rewriting the same goddamn object. So it's okay. But anyway, so that's another thing to fix. If I come back to our meeting notes, but, you know, and then you had one more thing around international standard of data governance for data protection. Can you tell me a bit more? Yeah, so I went to the conference where I went. So there one. Yeah. Yeah, share that link with me, that's super important. Awesome. and bend. This one has a cool feature like if you just do this and Yeah, yeah, so that happened as well. Yeah, I noticed that. to figure out in meeting context for ads. And does it pay for more than 4,000? Is this even needed? Can we do multiple? with same content. Thank you so much. is a typical article. That was a lot of food. or. Thanks for watching to backend for call. Like this is something to Um... Cool, so we have next steps for all of us. And if you need to spin up an entirely new instance for it, then... You need to also, the URLs are going to be used on our site. Yeah, actually, I actually tried to shut down the instance. But it says that due to some spot instance, you don't have the permission to. Yeah, it's provisioned, right? But then we're getting a much better rate than like a three-year contract on an instance, right? That would be like a few thousand dollars. Like that's fine. Once we get a client that's super easy, we'll just get that out of the way. But for the time being, but anyway, like I don't want to talk about, it's not about cost, this is about the design, right? So... who would probably be providing a URL to a load balancer. and only we can call the AI instance so that it is safe from like public requests, right? Like anyone, otherwise anyone can, once we push the code to. anyone can get the URL and just spam your, like, Inferencia 2 backend, right? So authentication and security is one really important thing. Otherwise, we don't go live, right? Create the API. Like, you don't need the, you don't need, like, you can always develop locally, right? You'll do AWS deploy and you can query it. But setting up the API is a lot of other work as well, right? So I think you're doing that now, but like a couple of... hard requirements there before the code gets checked in would be... Like, how do we figure out who is calling the API, and how do we do that, and all we want to allow. Number two is... Uh, how well rag is another thing to just generally consider. How do we manage context? Uh, right. And, uh, yeah, typically like what is the behavior of the API that, right? Is it like. messages every 30 seconds and then sending them to the server viable And then we'll get into like, okay, out of a single server, how many simultaneous calls can we support? Right? So all that will come with time. For now, I think authentication, getting that, oh, and the load balancer, right? Because what instances will come and go, they'll keep changing. But... like steps to spin up the thing. Do it documented, check the document into the code and put it in your design doc as well. So in the and you're saying this is set up, we can do a small demo thing, like this is the thing working. I sent you the diagram yesterday. Now you know how the front end works. So I think that kind of model would be helpful. your business is your But the That we think looking good, right? Like creating into like a little bit of client development and so on. real business is like the customers you have. We don't have an investor for a while, that's fine. If we, and we do everything is next month, that's fine. But like, if you don't have customers in the next two to three months, I'll be, I'll be really, really worried. If we don't have investors in the next two to three months, I'm not that worried. getting Like I need to customers do something but is then I like have six the other things to most do important as well So thing. we So need to start growing the team and as like, well and also like figuring out how can we support a customer. So like, we need to grow the team so we can start managing all of this because I think like, I don't want to be in a position where I'm like slowing you guys down because like all this work, I mean, Rishabh is already doing a lot of work, right? But like all this work is on me. So like, sometimes you can't do something because it's waiting. demo bring the what? Sorry. Oh, yeah. Thanks for reminding me. So what we're going to do, we'll just keep it to 30 seconds. I'll jump out of this call. I'll schedule a bot to this call again. I'll present the transcription into the call itself. So it's all that. Somehow we can Okay, so we need a small script. so I'll just do presentation mode into the meeting. So I'm just taking a recording of a single video. How we will do it, we'll worry about it later. But for now, the demo just needs to look like the demo. Also, do I have open AI credit to even run this experiment? Does anyone want to come up with a script of like, we need we need a future meeting? We can. So we're going to talk I think I still have that thing running somewhere. I have it running at two places literally. So that's it. Yeah. Funny thing is on both my clients, it's a bit different. boxes in both my clients. One is a blue and one a gray and another. So they're all managing like state differently and the server doesn't know. This is going to be another problem to figure out. If I take the same call and open like three transcript windows against it, right, my server is just going to keep bomba. So then the server will need to be the client, like science are managing that. Yeah, it's going to be fun, man. It's like a lot of fun problems to solve. But it's also exciting not complaining. OK. What is this damn thing, man? This is gonna be more like acting skills, this is not gonna be like... it is. Okay. And then on this, I'm going to force a thing in here. Yeah, so this is one, but like I can, so this is not the one we need. I had another data object that I. Hello. Thank you. This is all the same task, but I can modify this. So. In taskbox, do we include the task platform on that? Like for Asana, do we include Asana written on that? Google Meets or Google Meets written on that. It's more important that I just get a recording and then we can keep improving our recording. break my message okay then let me send the whole message So let me see if I can share this on. I'll just share a fiddle with you guys. See, one moment, let's video. Can you see this link? Can you see this pill? guys, this is the data. Yeah, did you get it as well? Uh, the one on the chat? Oh, So if you can send me. You see the send documents format, the like. create tasks and these are the notifications that are coming up. So like. and in person. So if you're figuring out how to do the demo, let's, so we need the, like, you need to fill this out. Give it back to me so I can actually trigger it on the demo if that makes sense I see. Yeah, I see. Okay. Yeah, so it will print exactly those notifications, right? And then we can come up with a script against it, right? So it's like, so I need a script and then I need the script translated into this. So we're creating like white, basically we're creating like perfect data. Okay, I mean, I'm gonna show script already. Should I send that script first? Yeah, check. Okay, just four lines. Four things. Okay. So hi, guys. Richie, can you let us know what needs to be done? from within the sector. Discuss the progress. We need to create a script against that. No, it's OK. We can change the fiddle to match the notifications we want to see. So just change the fiddle. Just change the fiddle and share the link with us. Um... Like you see this one task object, like I'm assigning this whole thing to A. but you can also create like three copies of this where the task list is just one thing. can you fake something? Something is written else on the document and something is there and we have nothing. So I mean, it's This is me saying this is what my product is. There's a fundamental difference, right? When Google comes out with a video like that, like two days before it's launched, it's a bit unethical because millions of users are going to have that expectation, right? And it's a bit of a... Anyway, whether or not they get sued by some court is that bad? Someone played with it and they actually wrote something like who created Gemini. They can't even answer that. They said that Anthropic created it. like okay cool so let me know when you're ready with the the fiddle or the new fiddle. And then the Actually the follow command is like I'd be... Go through the fiddles. No, it's okay. I like I'm we can have like multiple bots. I don't I don't really care. That's fine. Like, I don't want to make that. Let's let's get this bot out."
